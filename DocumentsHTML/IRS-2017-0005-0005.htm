Transfers of Certain Property by U.S. Persons to Partnerships 
With Related Foreign Partners

AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

ACTION: Final regulations and removal of temporary regulations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document contains final regulations that provide guidance 
applicable to transfers of appreciated property by U.S. persons to 
partnerships with foreign partners related to the transferor. 
Specifically, when a U.S. person transfers appreciated property to a 
partnership with a foreign partner related to the transferor, the 
regulations override the general nonrecognition rule unless the 
partnership adopts the remedial allocation method and certain other 
requirements are satisfied. The

[[Page 3834]]

regulations affect U.S. partners in domestic or foreign partnerships.

DATES: 
    Effective Date: These regulations are effective on January 17, 
2020.
    Applicability Dates: For dates of applicability, see Sec. Sec.  
1.197-2(l)(5)(i), 1.704-1(f), 1.704-3(g)(1), 1.721(c)-1(e), 1.721(c)-
2(e), 1.721(c)-3(e), 1.721(c)-4(d), 1.721(c)-5(g), 1.721(c)-6(g), and 
1.6038B-2(j)(4).

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    Section 721(c) was added to the Internal Revenue Code (the 
``Code'') by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, Public Law 105-34 (111 
Stat. 788). In section 721(c), Congress granted the Secretary 
regulatory authority to override the application of the nonrecognition 
provision of section 721(a) to gain realized on the transfer of 
property to a partnership (domestic or foreign) if the gain, when 
recognized, would be includible in the gross income of a person other 
than a U.S. person.
    On August 6, 2015, the Department of the Treasury (the ``Treasury 
Department'') and the IRS issued Notice 2015-54, 2015-34 I.R.B. 210, 
which announces an intent to issue regulations under section 721(c).
    On January 19, 2017, the Treasury Department and the IRS published 
temporary and final regulations (T.D. 9814) under sections 721(c), 197, 
704, and 6038B in the Federal Register (82 FR 7582) (the ``temporary 
regulations''). A notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-127203-15) cross-
referencing the temporary regulations was published in the same issue 
of the Federal Register (82 FR 6368 (the ``proposed regulations'' and 
together with the temporary regulations the ``2017 regulations'').
    No public hearing on the 2017 regulations was requested or held; 
however, the Treasury Department and the IRS received one written 
comment with respect to the 2017 regulations. The Comment Summary and 
Explanation of Revisions section summarizes the comment and discusses 
relevant provisions of the 2017 regulations.

Comment Summary and Explanation of Revisions

I. Overview

    The Treasury Department and the IRS received one comment regarding 
the 2017 regulations. After full consideration of the comment, this 
Treasury Decision adopts the rules contained in the proposed 
regulations with certain modifications. This Comment Summary and 
Explanation of Provisions section summarizes the comment received, 
explains the Treasury Department and the IRS's response to that 
comment, and discusses the modifications to the proposed regulations 
adopted in this Treasury Decision.

II. Comment

    The comment expressed concern that an intercompany transaction 
between a U.S. person and a foreign person may result in a deemed or 
``accidental partnership,'' despite no intention by the partners to 
create one and no realization one was created. As a consequence, the 
requirements under the regulations would not be met to avoid gain 
recognition under section 721(c). The comment recommended an additional 
exception to gain recognition under section 721(c) in these 
circumstances if the taxpayer has reasonably determined that the 
property in question was not contributed to a partnership, the taxpayer 
is not amortizing or depreciating the property for section 704(b) 
purposes with respect to the arrangement for which the property owner 
has entered into a transaction with a related party, and all parties 
involved consistently treat the arrangement, with respect to the 
subject property, as one to which subchapter K of the Code does not 
apply.
    The final regulations do not adopt this recommendation. The issue 
of what constitutes deemed or accidental partnerships and any relief 
that should be provided for them is not unique to the application of 
these regulations and, thus, goes beyond the scope of this Treasury 
Decision. Nevertheless, when an accidental partnership exists as the 
comment describes, the filing obligations under Sec.  1.6038B-
2(a)(1)(iii) (which cross references the reporting requirements under 
Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)) will have not been fulfilled and, therefore, the 
limitations period on assessment under section 6501(c)(8) will remain 
open until three years after the IRS is provided the information 
required to be reported under section 6038B. Accordingly, a taxpayer 
that makes a contribution to an accidental partnership could file 
amended returns applying the gain deferral method, including fulfilling 
its reporting requirements (see Sec.  1.721(c)-6(f)).

III. Modifications and Clarifications

A. Related Party Definition

    Section 1.721(c)-1T(b) provides definitions that apply for purposes 
of the 2017 regulations. Section 1.721(c)-1T(b)(12) provides that a 
related person is, with respect to a U.S. transferor, a person that is 
related (within the meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to the U.S. 
transferor. A related foreign person is, with respect to a U.S. 
transferor, a related person (other than a partnership) that is not a 
U.S. person. See Sec.  1.721(c)-1T(b)(11).
    The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that a 
modification to the definition of related person is appropriate to 
limit the application of these rules in certain situations. 
Specifically, a new paragraph is added in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(12) that 
provides that for purposes of determining if a person is a related 
person with respect to a U.S. transferor, section 267(b) is applied 
without regard to section 267(c)(3). This modification to the 
definition of related person provides relief when certain foreign 
individual partners of a partnership would be treated as a related 
person with respect to a domestic corporation by reason of section 
267(c)(3). This change is consistent with section 707(b)(3) and is 
intended to address the following specific fact pattern, or a variation 
thereof:
    A partnership (PRS1) has two partners: A foreign individual that 
holds 4 percent of the interests in PRS1's capital and profits and a 
U.S. individual (unrelated to the foreign individual) that holds 96 
percent of the interests in PRS1's capital and profits. PRS1 wholly 
owns a domestic corporation (UST). In Year 1, UST forms a new 
partnership (PRS2); as part of the formation, UST contributes section 
721(c) property (as defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(15)) in return for a 
90 percent interest in PRS2's capital and profits, and a U.S. 
individual (unrelated to UST) contributes cash in return for the 
remaining interest in PRS2's capital and profits.
    For purposes of determining whether PRS2 is a section 721(c) 
partnership (as defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(14)), the rules of 
section 267(b) must be applied to determine whether the foreign 
individual is a related foreign person with respect to UST. Section 
267(b)(2) provides that an individual is related to a corporation if 
the individual holds, directly or indirectly, more than 50 percent in 
value of the corporation's outstanding stock. In applying section 
267(b)(2), however, the constructive stock ownership rules of section 
267(c) must be taken into account. Section 267(c)(1) provides that 
stock owned, directly or indirectly, by a partnership will be treated 
as owned proportionally by its partners. Section 267(c)(5)

[[Page 3835]]

provides that stock owned constructively by reason of section 267(c)(1) 
will be treated as actually owned for purposes of applying section 
267(c)(3). Section 267(c)(3) provides that an individual owning any 
stock in a corporation shall be considered as owning the stock owned, 
directly or indirectly, by or for his partner. But section 267(c)(3) 
will not apply, and will therefore not attribute stock ownership to an 
individual partner, if the individual does not actually own, or 
constructively own under section 267(c)(1), stock in the corporation 
that is owned directly or indirectly by or for another partner of the 
partnership. See Sec.  1.267(c)-1(a)(2).
    In the facts provided, section 267(c)(1) treats the foreign 
individual as constructively owning a proportionate share of the UST 
stock that is owned by PRS1; accordingly, the foreign individual is 
treated as constructively owning 4 percent of the UST stock. And 
because the foreign individual constructively owns stock in UST under 
section 267(c)(1), section 267(c)(3) attributes the stock owned by the 
U.S individual (the other partner in PRS1) to the foreign individual. 
As a result, the foreign individual is treated as owning all of the 
value of UST's outstanding stock for purposes of determining 
relatedness under section 267(b)(2); therefore, the foreign individual 
is a related person with respect to the U.S. transferor under the rule 
provided in Sec.  1.721(c)-1T(b)(12) of the 2017 regulations. However, 
because the modified definition of related person provided in this 
Treasury Decision applies section 267(b) without regard to section 
267(c)(3), the foreign individual will not be treated as a related 
person under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(12)(ii). As a consequence, PRS2 is not 
a section 721(c) partnership.

B. Consistent Allocation Method

    Section 1.721(c)-3T(b) of the 2017 regulations provides the 
requirements of the gain deferral method. Among the requirements, a 
section 721(c) partnership is required to adopt the remedial allocation 
method and apply the consistent allocation method with respect to 
section 721(c) property. The consistent allocation method, as described 
in Sec.  1.721(c)-3T(c)(1), provides that for each taxable year of a 
section 721(c) partnership in which there is remaining built-in gain in 
section 721(c) property, the section 721(c) partnership must allocate 
each book item of income, gain, deduction, and loss with respect to the 
section 721(c) property to the U.S. transferor in the same percentage 
for the taxable year. Although the consistent allocation method 
requires each book item of income, gain, deduction, and loss with 
respect to section 721(c) property to be allocated to a U.S. transferor 
in the same percentage for a single taxable year, the consistent 
allocation method does not require the allocations to be in the same 
percentage among all taxable years in which the gain deferral method is 
applied. The consistent allocation method, therefore, prevents a U.S. 
transferor from rendering the remedial allocation method ineffective 
by, for example, having the partnership allocate a higher percentage of 
book deprecation to the U.S. transferor than the U.S. transferor's 
percentage share of income or gain with respect to the section 721(c) 
property. See preamble to the temporary regulations (82 FR at 7589). 
The consistent allocation method, therefore, ensures that the built-in 
gain in section 721(c) property will be subject to U.S. tax.
    The Treasury Department and the IRS have determined that a 
modification to Sec.  1.721(c)-3T(c)(1) of the 2017 regulations is 
appropriate to clarify the application of the consistent allocation 
method. Specifically, a new sentence is added in Sec.  1.721(c)-
3(c)(1); the new sentence provides that upon a variation (as described 
in Sec.  1.706-4(a)(1)) of a U.S. transferor's interest in a section 
721(c) partnership, book items with respect to section 721(c) property 
that are allocated under the interim closing method (as described in 
Sec.  1.706-4) will be treated as allocated in the same percentage for 
purposes of applying the consistent allocation method in a single 
taxable year unless the variation results from a transaction undertaken 
with a principal purpose of avoiding the tax consequences of the gain 
deferral method.
    If any partner's interest in a partnership changes during a taxable 
year of the partnership, section 706(d) grants the Secretary regulatory 
authority to prescribe rules for determining each partner's 
distributive share of any partnership item for the taxable year that 
takes into account the partner's varying interests in the partnership. 
The variations described in section 706(d) include, among other things, 
a reduction in a partner's interest in a partnership, including a 
reduction that occurs due to the entry of a new partner. See Sec.  
1.706-4(a). If a partner's interest in a partnership is reduced during 
a taxable year, but not completely disposed of, the taxable year of the 
partnership will not close as a result of the variation. See section 
706(c)(2)(B). Instead, if a variation occurs during the taxable year of 
a partnership, Sec.  1.706-4(a)(3) generally allows the partnership to 
choose how to determine each partner's share of the partnership items 
for the taxable year under either the proration method or the interim 
closing method. See Sec.  1.706-4(a)(3)(iii). The interim closing 
method divides the taxable year of the partnership into segments based 
on the interim closings of the partnership's books; the segments are 
then used to apportion the partnership items for the year among its 
segments, and to determine, taking into account the partners' interests 
during each segment, the partners' distributive shares of the 
partnership items. See generally Sec.  1.706-4(a)(3).
    The modification to the consistent allocation method when the 
interim closing method is applied is intended to clarify that a U.S. 
transferor continues to comply with the consistent allocation method 
following certain economic events that do not close the taxable year of 
the section 721(c) partnership. Given the high thresholds required to 
be subject to these rules, the Treasury Department and the IRS have 
determined that allowing the partnership to choose the proration method 
is not appropriate for the consistent allocation method: A section 
721(c) partnership will have the resources and capabilities necessary 
to comply with the more precise interim closing method without imposing 
an undue burden on the partnership.

C. Reporting

    The final regulations include the reporting requirements provided 
in the 2017 regulations regarding both gain deferral contributions and 
the annual reporting requirements with respect to section 721(c) 
property to which the gain deferral method applies. The 2017 
regulations require much of the reporting to be on statements attached 
to returns. See Sec. Sec.  1.721(c)-6T and 1.6038B-2T. Since the 
issuance of the 2017 regulations, however, the IRS has updated and 
added new schedules to Form 8865, Return of U.S. Persons With Respect 
to Certain Foreign Partnerships, to facilitate compliance with these 
reporting requirements. The IRS has also issued new Form 8838-P, 
Consent To Extend the Time To Assess Tax Pursuant to the Gain Deferral 
Method (Section 721(c)). The purpose of these changes was to include 
the information that previously was reported on the statements. The 
final regulations reference and require the use of these forms and 
schedules to fulfill the reporting requirements. For tax returns filed 
before March 17, 2020, however, Sec.  1.721(c)-6(g)(3)(ii) provides 
relief for reporting that met the requirements of

[[Page 3836]]

Sec.  1.721(c)-6T (as in effect before January 1, 2020).
    The final regulations also clarify the duration for which the U.S. 
transferor must extend the period of limitations on the assessment of 
tax under Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b). Section 1.721(c)-6(b)(5) clarifies the 
relevant periods to which Form 8838-P applies by measuring each period 
by the number of months occurring after the relevant date; accordingly, 
the final regulations measure each period by a fixed term that is 
determinable on the date of contribution. The final regulations also 
provide a similar clarification in Sec.  1.721(c)-6(f)(2).

D. Technical Terminations

    Section 708(b) generally provides that a partnership will terminate 
if the partnership ceases to do business. Before the enactment of the 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Public Law 115-97 (2017) (the ``TCJA''), section 
708(b)(1)(B) provided another way for a partnership to terminate: A 
partnership terminated if within any 12-month period, 50 percent or 
more of the total interest in partnership capital and profits was sold 
or exchanged. The termination described in section 708(b)(1)(B) is 
commonly referred to as a ``technical termination.'' The regulations in 
Sec.  1.708-1(b)(4) provide that a technical termination results in a 
deemed contribution of all the terminated partnership's assets and 
liabilities to a new partnership in exchange for an interest in the new 
partnership, followed by a deemed distribution of interests in the new 
partnership to both the purchasing partners and the remaining partners.
    The TCJA repealed section 708(b)(1)(B) for all partnership taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2017; therefore, technical 
terminations no longer apply. See Conference Report on H.R. 1, Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act, H. Rept. 115-446, at 416.
    The 2017 regulations provide rules regarding technical terminations 
in two contexts: They provide that a partnership will not be treated as 
a section 721(c) partnership (as defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1T(b)(14)) 
following a deemed contribution that occurs as a result of a technical 
termination, and they treat certain technical terminations as successor 
events for purposes of the acceleration event exceptions provided in 
Sec.  1.721(c)-5T. See Sec. Sec.  1.721(c)-2T(d)(2) and 1.721(c)-
5T(c)(4).
    The rules in the 2017 regulations regarding technical terminations 
are retained in this Treasury Decision. Although the TCJA repealed 
section 708(b)(1)(B), the applicability date for these final 
regulations relates back to the applicability date provided in the 2017 
regulations, which is before the effective date provided in the TCJA. 
Accordingly, the rules provided in this Treasury Decision regarding 
technical terminations will have limited applicability; the rules will 
only apply to technical terminations occurring on or after the 
applicability date provided in the 2017 regulations but before the 
effective date for the repeal of section 708(b)(1)(B) provided in the 
TCJA.

E. Request for Comments

    Under the final regulations, as well as the 2017 regulations, stock 
is excluded from the definition of section 721(c) property and, 
therefore, a contribution of stock of a controlled foreign corporation 
(within the meaning of section 957) (``CFC'') to a section 721(c) 
partnership is not subject to the final regulations. However, the 
Treasury Department and the IRS are concerned that taxpayers may avail 
themselves of partnerships to shift the tax liability, in whole or in 
part, with respect to earnings of a CFC attributable to subpart F 
income (within the meaning of section 952) or tested income (within the 
meaning of section 951A(c)(2)(A) and Sec.  1.951A-2(b)(1)) to a related 
foreign partner that is not owned (within the meaning of section 
958(a)) by a United States shareholder (within the meaning of section 
951(b)). The Treasury Department and the IRS are studying the use of 
partnerships in this context, including under what circumstances it may 
be appropriate to apply section 721(c) to a contribution of stock of a 
CFC to a partnership. The Treasury Department and the IRS request 
comments on this matter.

Special Analyses

I. Regulatory Planning and Review

    The Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory 
Affairs (OIRA), Office of Management and Budget, has determined that 
this rule is not a significant regulatory action, as that term is 
defined in section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866. Therefore, OIRA has 
not reviewed this rule pursuant to section 6(a)(3)(A) of Executive 
Order 12866 and the April 11, 2018, Memorandum of Agreement between the 
Department of Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
    Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), it 
is hereby certified that the collection of information contained in 
this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. This certification is based on 
the fact that the regulations include a $1,000,000 de minimis exception 
for certain transfers and exclude contributions of tangible property 
with built-in gain that does not exceed $20,000. In addition, the 
regulations apply only when a U.S. transferor contributes property to a 
partnership with a partner that is a related foreign person and persons 
related to the U.S. transferor own more than 80 percent of the 
interests in the partnership. Accordingly, the Treasury Department and 
the IRS expect that these regulations primarily will affect large 
domestic corporations. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, these 
regulations have been submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of 
the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small 
business.

II. Paperwork Reduction Act

    The collection of information imposed by these regulations is 
contained in Sec. Sec.  1.721(c)-6 and 1.6038B-2. The collection of 
information provided by these regulations has been reviewed and 
approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 
1545-1668 and 1545-0123. The information is required to comply with the 
gain deferral method, which generally allows a U.S. transferor to avoid 
immediate gain recognition upon a contribution of section 721(c) 
property to a section 721(c) partnership. The likely respondents are 
domestic corporations. Estimates for completing these forms can be 
located in the instructions to Forms 8865, 8838-P, and 1065.
    Upon a contribution of section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) 
partnership, a U.S. transferor must comply with the gain deferral 
method described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3 to avoid immediate gain 
recognition. To comply with the gain deferral method, Sec.  1.721(c)-
3(b)(3) provides that the procedural and reporting requirements of 
Sec.  1.721(c)-6 must be met; additionally, Sec.  1.721(c)-3(b)(4) 
provides that a U.S. transferor must consent to an extension of the 
period of limitations on assessment of tax as required by Sec.  
1.721(c)-6(b)(5).
    Section 1.721(c)-6(b) describes the procedural and reporting 
requirements of a U.S. transferor. The collection of information 
described in Sec. Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)(2) and (c)(2) and 1.6038B-
2(a)(1)(iii) regarding a gain deferral contribution is provided by the 
U.S. transferor to the IRS on any applicable Schedules to Form 8865, 
Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships, 
and is mandatory; the relevant Schedules include, as

[[Page 3837]]

applicable, Schedule A-1, Certain Foreign Partners; Schedule A-2, 
Foreign Partners of Section 721(c) Partnership; Schedule G, Statement 
of Application of the Gain Deferral Method Under Section 721(c); 
Schedule H, Acceleration Events and Exceptions Reporting Relating to 
Gain Deferral Method Under Section 721(c); and Schedule O, Transfer of 
Property to a Foreign Partnership. The information will be used by the 
U.S. transferor to comply with the gain deferral method.
    The collection of information described in Sec. Sec.  1.721(c)-
6(b)(3) and 1.6038B-2(a)(1)(iii) is provided on Schedules G, H, and O 
of Form 8865 and is mandatory. The information will be used by the U.S. 
transferor to annually report information for each gain deferral 
contribution.
    The collection of information described in Sec.  1.721(c)-
6(b)(3)(iii), if not already provided elsewhere, is provided on Form 
8865, Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign 
Partnerships, and is mandatory. The information will be used by the 
U.S. transferor to comply with the gain deferral method.
    The collection of information described in Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)(5) 
is provided by the U.S. transferor to the IRS on Form 8838-P, Consent 
To Extend the Time To Assess Tax Pursuant to the Gain Deferral Method 
(Section 721(c)), and is mandatory. The information will be used by the 
U.S. transferor to extend the period of limitations on the assessment 
of tax to ensure that the gain deferral method is properly applied.
    If a section 721(c) partnership does not have a filing obligation 
under section 6031, the collection of information described in Sec.  
1.721(c)-6(c)(3) is provided by a section 721(c) partnership to a U.S. 
transferor on Schedule K-1 (Form 8865), Partner's Share of Income, 
Deduction, Credits, etc., for all related foreign persons that are 
direct or indirect partners in the section 721(c) partnership. The 
information will be used by the U.S. transferor to annually report 
information for each gain deferral contribution.
    If a section 721(c) partnership has a filing obligation under 
section 6031, the collection of information described in Sec.  
1.721(c)-6(d)(2) is provided by the section 721(c) partnership to the 
U.S. transferor on Schedule K-1 (Form 1065). The information will be 
used by the U.S. transferor to comply with the requirements of the gain 
deferral method provided in Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)(2) and (3).

    The numbers of respondents in the Revision of Existing Forms table 
were estimated by the Research, Applied Analytics and Statistics 
Division of the IRS from the Compliance Data Warehouse and Statistics 
of Income, using tax year 2017. Data for each of the Forms 8865, 8838-
P, and 1065 represent preliminary estimates of the total number of 
additional taxpayers that are expected to file these forms. The tax 
data for 2018 is not yet available.

III. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take 
certain other actions before issuing a final rule that includes any 
Federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a 
state, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private 
sector, of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for 
inflation. In 2019, that threshold is approximately $154 million. These 
regulations do not include any Federal mandate that may result in 
expenditures by state, local, or tribal governments, or by the private 
sector in excess of that threshold.

IV. Executive Order 13132: Federalism

    Executive Order 13132 (entitled ``Federalism'') prohibits an agency 
from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule 
either imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on state and local 
governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts state law, 
unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of 
section 6 of the Executive order. This final rule does not have 
federalism implications and does not impose substantial direct 
compliance costs on state and local governments or preempt state law 
within the meaning of the Executive order.

Drafting Information

    The principal authors of these regulations are Chadwick Rowland and 
Ronald M. Gootzeit, Office of the Associate Chief Counsel 
(International). However, other personnel from the Treasury Department 
and the IRS participated in their development.

    (6) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(f)(5) of this section, the 
revaluation is required under Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(1) as a condition of 
the application of the gain deferral method (as described in Sec.  
1.721(c)-3(b)) and is pursuant to an event described in this paragraph 
(b)(2)(iv)(f)(6). If an interest in a partnership is contributed to a 
section 721(c) partnership (as defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(14)), the 
partnership whose interest is contributed may revalue its property in 
accordance with this section. In this case, the revaluation by the 
partnership whose interest was contributed must occur immediately 
before the contribution. If a partnership that revalues its property 
pursuant to this paragraph owns an interest in another partnership, the 
partnership in which it owns an interest may also revalue its property 
in accordance with this section. When multiple partnerships revalue 
under this paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(f)(6), the revaluations occur in order 
from the lowest-tier partnership to the highest-tier partnership.
* * * * *
    (f) Applicability dates--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (f)(2) of this section, paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(f)(6) of this

and with respect to a contribution that occurred before August 6, 2015 
resulting from an entity classification election made under Sec.  
301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or before August 6, 
2015 but was filed on or after August 6, 2015. The election must have 
been made by applying paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(f)(6) of this section on a 
timely filed original return (including extensions) or an amended 
return filed no later than July 18, 2017.


Sec.  1.704-1T  [Amended]

0
Par. 5. Paragraphs (b)(2)(iv)(f)(6) and (f) of Sec.  1.704-1T are 
removed.

0
Par. 6. Section 1.704-3 is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(13), 
(d)(5)(iii), and (g) to read as follows:


Sec.  1.704-3  Contributed property.

    (a) * * *
    (13) Rules for tiered section 721(c) partnerships--(i) 
Revaluations. If a partnership revalues its property pursuant to Sec.  
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(6) immediately before an interest in the 
partnership is contributed to another partnership, or if an upper-tier 
partnership owns an interest in a lower-tier partnership, and both the 
upper-tier partnership and the lower-tier partnership revalue 
partnership property pursuant to Sec.  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(6), the 
principles of paragraph (a)(9) of this section will apply to any 
reverse section 704(c) allocations made as a result of the revaluation.
    (ii) Basis-derivative items. If a lower-tier partnership that is a 
section 721(c) partnership applies the gain deferral method, then, for 
purposes of applying this section, the upper-tier partnership must 
treat its distributive share of lower-tier partnership items of gain, 
loss, amortization, depreciation, or other cost recovery with respect 
to the lower-tier partnership's section 721(c) property as though they 
were items of gain, loss, amortization, depreciation, or other cost 
recovery with respect to the upper-tier partnership's interest in the 
lower-tier partnership. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(13)(ii), 
gain deferral method is defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(8), section 
721(c) partnership is defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(14), and section 
721(c) property is defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(15).
* * * * *
    (d) * * *
    (5) * * *
    (iii) Special rules for a section 721(c) partnership and anti-
churning property--(A) In general. Solely in the case of a gain 
deferral contribution of section 721(c) property that is a section 
197(f)(9) intangible that was not an amortizable section 197 intangible 
in the hands of the contributor, the remedial allocation method is 
modified with respect to allocations to a related person to the U.S. 
transferor pursuant to paragraphs (d)(5)(iii)(B) through (F) of this 
section. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(5)(iii), gain deferral 
contribution is defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(7), related person is 
defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(12), section 721(c) partnership is 
defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-

[[Page 3839]]

1(b)(14), section 721(c) property is defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-
1(b)(15), and U.S. transferor is defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(18). 
For an example applying the rules of this paragraph (d)(5)(iii), see 
Sec.  1.721(c)-7(b)(6) (Example 6).
    (B) Book basis recovery. The section 721(c) partnership must 
amortize the portion of the partnership's book value in the section 
197(f)(9) intangible that exceeds the adjusted basis in the property 
upon contribution using any recovery period and amortization method 
available to the partnership as if the property had been newly 
purchased by the partnership from an unrelated party.
    (C) Effect of ceiling rule limitations. If the ceiling rule causes 
the book allocation of the item of amortization of a section 197(f)(9) 
intangible under paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(B) of this section by a section 
721(c) partnership to a related person with respect to the U.S. 
transferor to differ from the tax allocation of the same item to the 
related person (a ceiling rule limited related person), the partnership 
must not create a remedial item of deduction to allocate to the related 
person but instead must increase the adjusted basis of the section 
197(f)(9) intangible by an amount equal to the difference solely with 
respect to that related person. The partnership simultaneously must 
create an offsetting remedial item in an amount identical to the 
increase in adjusted tax basis of the section 197(f)(9) intangible and 
allocate it to the contributing partner.
    (D) Effect of basis adjustment--(1) In general. The basis 
adjustment described in paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(C) of this section 
constitutes an adjustment to the adjusted basis of a section 197(f)(9) 
intangible with respect to the ceiling rule limited related person 
only. No adjustment is made to the common basis of partnership 
property. Thus, for purposes of calculating gain and loss, the ceiling 
rule limited related person will have a special basis for that section 
197(f)(9) intangible. The adjustment to the basis of partnership 
property under this section has no effect on the partnership's 
computation of any item under section 703.
    (2) Computation of a partner's distributive share of partnership 
items. The partnership first computes its items of gain or loss at the 
partnership level under section 703. The partnership then allocates the 
partnership items among the partners, including the ceiling rule 
limited related person, in accordance with section 704, and adjusts the 
partners' capital accounts accordingly. The partnership then adjusts 
the ceiling rule limited related person's distributive share of the 
items of partnership gain or loss, in accordance with paragraph 
(d)(5)(iii)(D)(3) of this section, to reflect the effects of that 
person's basis adjustment under this section. These adjustments to that 
person's distributive shares must be reflected on Schedules K and K-1 
of the partnership's return (Form 1065) (when otherwise required to be 
completed) and do not affect that person's capital account.
    (3) Effect of basis adjustment in determining items of income, 
gain, or loss. The amount of a ceiling rule limited related person's 
gain or loss from the sale or exchange of a section 197(f)(9) 
intangible in which that person has a tax basis adjustment is equal to 
that person's share of the partnership's gain or loss from the sale of 
the asset (including any remedial allocations under this paragraph 
(d)), minus the amount of that person's tax basis adjustment for the 
section 197(f)(9) intangible.
    (E) Subsequent transfers--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(E)(2) of this section, if a ceiling rule limited 
related person transfers all or part of its partnership interest, the 
portion of the basis adjustment for a section 197(f)(9) intangible 
attributable to the interest transferred is eliminated. The transferor 
of the partnership interest remains the ceiling rule limited related 
person with respect to any remaining basis adjustment for the section 
197(f)(9) intangible.
    (2) Special rules for substituted basis transactions. Paragraph 
(d)(5)(iii)(E)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent a 
ceiling rule limited related person transfers its partnership interest 
in a transaction in which the transferee's basis in the partnership 
interest is determined in whole or in part by reference to the ceiling 
rule limited related person's basis in that interest. Instead, in such 
a case, the transferee succeeds to that portion of the transferor's 
basis adjustment for a section 197(f)(9) intangible attributable to the 
interest transferred. In such a case, the basis adjustment in a section 
197(f)(9) intangible to which the transferee succeeds is taken into 
account for purposes of determining the transferee's share of the 
adjusted basis to the partnership of the partnership's property for 
purposes of Sec. Sec.  1.743-1(b) and 1.755-1(b)(5). To the extent a 
transferee would be required to decrease the adjusted basis of a 
section 197(f)(9) intangible pursuant to Sec. Sec.  1.743-1(b)(2) and 
1.755-1(b)(5), the decrease first reduces the special basis adjustment 
described in paragraph (d)(5)(iii)(C) of this section, if any, to which 
the transferee succeeds.
    (F) Non-amortization of basis adjustment. Neither the increase to 
the adjusted basis of a section 197(f)(9) intangible with respect to a 
ceiling rule limited related person nor the portion of the basis of any 
property that was determined by reference to such increase is subject 
to amortization, depreciation, or other cost recovery.
* * * * *
    (g) Applicability dates for rules for section 721(c) partnerships--
(1) In general. Notwithstanding paragraph (f) of this section, except 
as provided in paragraph (g)(2) of this section, paragraphs (a)(13) and 
(d)(5)(iii) of this section apply with respect to contributions 
occurring on or after January 18, 2017, and with respect to 
contributions that occurred before January 18, 2017 resulting from an 
entity classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this 
chapter that was effective on or before January 18, 2017 but was filed 
on or after January 18, 2017.
    (2) Election to apply the provisions described in paragraph (g)(1) 
of this section retroactively. Paragraphs (a)(13) and (d)(5)(iii) of 
this section may, by election, be applied with respect to a 
contribution that occurred on or after August 6, 2015 but before 
January 18, 2017, and with respect to a contribution that occurred 
before August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity classification election 
made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or 
before August 6, 2015 but was filed on or after August 6, 2015. The 
election must have been made by applying paragraph (a)(13) or 
(d)(5)(iii) of this section, as applicable, on a timely filed original 
return (including extensions) or an amended return filed no later than 
July 18, 2017.

Par. 8. Section 1.721(c)-1 is added to read as follows:


Sec.  1.721(c)-1  Overview, definitions, and rules of general 
application.

    (a) Overview--(1) In general. This section and Sec. Sec.  1.721(c)-
2 through 1.721(c)-7 (collectively, the section 721(c) regulations) 
provide rules under section 721(c). This section provides definitions 
and rules of general application for purposes of the section 721(c) 
regulations. Section 1.721(c)-2 provides the general operative rules 
that override section 721(a) nonrecognition of gain upon a contribution 
of section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership. Section 
1.721(c)-3

[[Page 3840]]

describes the gain deferral method, which may be applied in order to 
avoid the immediate recognition of gain upon a contribution of section 
721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership. Section 1.721(c)-4 
provides rules regarding acceleration events for purposes of applying 
the gain deferral method. Section 1.721(c)-5 identifies exceptions to 
the rules regarding acceleration events provided in Sec.  1.721(c)-
4(b). Section 1.721(c)-6 provides procedural and reporting 
requirements. Section 1.721(c)-7 provides examples illustrating the 
application of the section 721(c) regulations.
    (2) Scope. Paragraph (b) of this section provides definitions.

the section 721(c) regulations. Unless otherwise indicated, the 
definitions apply on a property-by-property basis, as applicable.
    (1) Acceleration event. An acceleration event has the meaning 
provided in Sec.  1.721(c)-4(b).
    (2) Built-in gain. Built-in gain is, with respect to property 
contributed to a partnership, the excess of the book value of the 
property over the partnership's adjusted tax basis in the property upon 
the contribution, determined without regard to the application of Sec.  
1.721(c)-2(b).
    (3) Consistent allocation method. The consistent allocation method 
is the method described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(c).
    (4) Controlled partnership. A partnership is a controlled 
partnership with respect to a U.S. transferor if the U.S. transferor 
and related persons control the partnership. For purposes of this 
paragraph (b)(4), control is determined based on all the facts and 
circumstances, except that a partnership will be deemed to be 
controlled by a U.S. transferor and related persons if those persons, 
in the aggregate, own (directly or indirectly through one or more 
partnerships) more than 50 percent of the interests in the partnership 
capital or profits.
    (5) Direct or indirect partner. A direct or indirect partner is a 
person (other than a partnership) that owns an interest in a 
partnership directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships.
    (6) Excluded property. Excluded property is--
    (i) A cash equivalent;
    (ii) A security within the meaning of section 475(c)(2), without 
regard to section 475(c)(4);
    (iii) Tangible property with a book value exceeding adjusted tax 
basis by no more than $20,000 or with an adjusted tax basis in excess 
of book value; and
    (iv) An interest in a partnership in which 90 percent or more of 
the property (as measured by value) held by the partnership (directly 
or indirectly through interests in one or more partnerships that are 
not excluded property) consists of property described in paragraphs 
(b)(6)(i) through (iii) of this section.
    (7) Gain deferral contribution. A gain deferral contribution is a 
contribution of section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership 
with respect to which the recognition of gain is deferred under the 
gain deferral method.
    (8) Gain deferral method. The gain deferral method is the method 
described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(b).
    (9) Partial acceleration event. A partial acceleration event is an 
event described in Sec.  1.721(c)-5(d)(2) or (3).
    (10) Regulatory allocation. A regulatory allocation is--
    (i) An allocation pursuant to a minimum gain chargeback, as defined 
in Sec.  1.704-2(b)(2);
    (ii) A partner nonrecourse deduction, as determined in Sec.  1.704-
2(i)(2);
    (iii) An allocation pursuant to a partner minimum gain chargeback, 
as described in Sec.  1.704-2(i)(4);
    (iv) An allocation pursuant to a qualified income offset, as 
defined in Sec.  1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d);
    (v) An allocation with respect to the exercise of a noncompensatory 
option described in Sec.  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s); and
    (vi) An allocation of partnership level ordinary income or loss 
described in Sec.  1.751-1(b)(3).
    (11) Related foreign person. A related foreign person is, with 
respect to a U.S. transferor, a related person (other than a 
partnership) that is not a U.S. person.
    (12) Related person--(i) In general. A related person is, with 
respect to a U.S. transferor, a person that is related (within the 
meaning of section 267(b) or 707(b)(1)) to the U.S. transferor.
    (ii) Modification to the application of section 267(b). For 
purposes of determining if a person is a related person with respect to 
a U.S. transferor, section 267(b) is applied without regard to section 
267(c)(3).
    (13) Remaining built-in gain--(i) In general. Remaining built-in 
gain is, with respect to section 721(c) property subject to the gain 
deferral method, the built-in gain reduced by decreases in the 
difference between the property's book value and adjusted tax basis, 
but, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(13)(i), without taking into 
account increases or decreases to the property's book value pursuant to 
Sec.  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) or (s).
    (ii) Special rule for tiered partnerships. If section 721(c) 
property is described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(1)(ii), the remaining 
built-in gain includes the new positive reverse section 704(c) layer 
described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(1)(ii), reduced by decreases in the 
difference between the property's book value and adjusted tax basis, 
but, for purposes of this paragraph (b)(13)(ii), without taking into 
account increases or decreases to the property's book value pursuant to 
Sec.  1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f) or (s) that are unrelated to the revaluation 
described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(1)(i).
    (14) Section 721(c) partnership--(i) In general. A partnership 
(domestic or foreign) is a section 721(c) partnership if there is a 
contribution of section 721(c) property to the partnership and, after 
the contribution and all transactions related to the contribution--
    (A) A related foreign person with respect to the U.S. transferor is 
a direct or indirect partner in the partnership; and
    (B) The U.S. transferor and related persons own 80 percent or more 
of the interests in partnership capital, profits, deductions, or 
losses.
    (ii) Special rule for tiered partnerships. A partnership described 
in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(1) or (2) is deemed to be a section 721(c) 
partnership for purposes of the gain deferral method.
    (15) Section 721(c) property--(i) In general. Section 721(c) 
property is property, other than excluded property, with built-in gain 
that is contributed to a partnership by a U.S. transferor, including 
pursuant to a contribution described in Sec.  1.721(c)-2(d) 
(partnership look-through rule). If the U.S. transferor is treated as 
contributing its share of property to a partnership pursuant to Sec.  
1.721(c)-2(d), the entire property will be section 721(c) property.
    (ii) Special rule for tiered partnerships. Property described in 
Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(1)(ii) and an interest in a partnership described 
in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(2)(ii) is deemed to be section 721(c) property.
    (16) Successor event. A successor event is an event described in 
Sec.  1.721(c)-5(c)(2), (3), (4), or (5).
    (17) Termination event. A termination event is an event described 
in Sec.  1.721(c)-5(b)(2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7).
    (18) U.S. transferor--(i) In general. A U.S. transferor is a United 
States person within the meaning of section 7701(a)(30) (a U.S. 
person), other than a domestic partnership.

[[Page 3841]]

    (ii) Special rule for tiered partnerships. Solely for purposes of 
applying the consistent allocation method, a U.S. transferor includes a 
partnership that is treated as a U.S. transferor under Sec.  1.721(c)-
3(d)(1)(iii) or (d)(2)(i).
    (c) Change in form of a partnership. A mere change in identity, 
form, or place of organization of a partnership or a recapitalization 
of a partnership will not cause the partnership to become a section 
721(c) partnership.
    (d) Anti-abuse rule. If a U.S. transferor engages in a transaction 
(or series of transactions) or an arrangement with a principal purpose 
of avoiding the application of the section 721(c) regulations, the 
transaction (or series of transactions) or the arrangement may be 
recharacterized (including by aggregating or disregarding steps or 
disregarding an intermediate entity) in accordance with its substance.
    (e) Applicability dates--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies to 
contributions occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and to 
contributions that occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an 
entity classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this 
chapter that was effective on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on

chapter that was effective on or before January 18, 2017 but was filed 
on or after January 18, 2017. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section, paragraph (b)(14)(i)(B) of this section applies by 
replacing ``80 percent or more'' with ``greater than 50 percent'' with 
respect to contributions that occurred on or after August 6, 2015 but 
before January 18, 2017, and with respect to contributions that 
occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity classification 
election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective 
on or before August 6, 2015, but was filed on or after August 6, 2015 
but before January 18, 2017. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section, paragraph (b)(12)(ii) of this section applies to

applicable, to the contribution on a timely filed original return 
(including extensions) or an amended return filed no later than July 
18, 2017. Paragraph (b)(12)(ii) of this section, may, by election, be 
applied to a contribution that occurred on or after August 6, 2015 but 
before January 17, 2020, and to a contribution that occurred before 
August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity classification election made 
under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or before

Par. 10. Section 1.721(c)-2 is added to read as follows:


Sec.  1.721(c)-2  Recognition of gain on certain contributions of 
property to partnerships with related foreign partners.

    (a) Scope. This section provides the general operative rules that 
override section 721(a) nonrecognition of gain upon a contribution of 
section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership. Paragraph (b) 
of this section provides the general rule that nonrecognition of gain 
under section 721(a) does not apply to a contribution of section 721(c) 
property to a section 721(c) partnership. Paragraph (c) of this section 
provides a de minimis exception to the application of the general rule 
in paragraph (b) of this section. Paragraph (d) of this section 
provides rules for identifying a section 721(c) partnership when a 
partnership in which a U.S. transferor is a direct or indirect partner 
contributes property to another partnership. Paragraph (e) of this 
section provides the dates of applicability. For definitions that apply 
for purposes of this section, see Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b).
    (b) General rule for contributions of section 721(c) property. 
Except as provided in this paragraph (b), paragraph (c) of this 
section, and Sec.  1.721(c)-3 (describing the gain deferral method), 
nonrecognition under section 721(a) will not apply to gain realized by 
the contributing partner upon a contribution of section 721(c) property 
to a section 721(c) partnership. This paragraph (b) does not apply to a 
direct contribution by a U.S. transferor if the U.S. transferor and 
related persons with respect to the U.S. transferor do not own 80 
percent or more of the interests in partnership capital, profits, 
deductions, or losses.
    (c) De minimis exception. Paragraph (b) of this section will not 
apply with respect to contributions to a section 721(c) partnership 
during a taxable year of the section 721(c) partnership for which the 
sum of the built-in gain with respect to all section 721(c) property 
contributed in that taxable year does not exceed $1 million. If, 
pursuant to the last sentence of paragraph (b) of this section, a 
direct contribution of property to the section 721(c) partnership by a 
U.S. transferor is not subject to paragraph (b) of this section, then 
such contribution is not taken into account for purposes of this 
paragraph (c).
    (d) Rules for identifying a section 721(c) partnership when a 
partnership contributes property to another partnership--(1) 
Partnership look-through rule. If a U.S. transferor is a direct or 
indirect partner in a partnership (upper-tier partnership) and the 
upper-tier partnership contributes all or a portion of its property to 
another partnership (lower-tier partnership), then, for purposes of 
determining if the lower-tier partnership is a section 721(c) 
partnership, the U.S. transferor is treated as contributing to the 
lower-tier partnership its share of the property actually contributed 
by the upper-tier partnership to the lower-tier partnership.
    (2) Exception for a technical termination of a partnership. 
Paragraph (d)(1) of this section will not apply to a deemed 
contribution that occurs as a result of a termination of a partnership 
described in section 708(b)(1)(B) (technical termination). If a 
partnership is a section 721(c) partnership immediately before a 
technical termination, see Sec.  1.721(c)-5(c)(4) (which treats 
technical terminations as successor events in certain circumstances).

[[Page 3842]]

    (e) Applicability dates--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies to 
contributions occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and to 
contributions that occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an 
entity classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this 
chapter that was effective on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on 
or after August 6, 2015.
    (2) Certain provisions. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section, the final sentence of paragraph (b) of this section, the 
final sentence of paragraph (c) of this section, and paragraph (d)(2) 
of this section apply to contributions occurring on or after January 
18, 2017, and to contributions that occurred before January 18, 2017 
resulting from an entity classification election made under Sec.  
301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or before January 18, 
2017 but was filed on or after January 18, 2017.
    (3) Election to apply the provisions described in paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section retroactively. The final sentence of paragraph (b) of 
this section, the final sentence of paragraph (c) of this section, and 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section may, by election, be applied to a 
contribution that occurred on or after August 6, 2015 but before 
January 18, 2017, and to a contribution that occurred before August 6, 
2015 resulting from an entity classification election made under Sec.  
301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or before August 6, 
2015 but was filed on or after August 6, 2015. The election must have 
been made by applying the final sentence of paragraph (b) of this 
section, the final sentence of paragraph (c) of this section, or 
paragraph (d)(2) of this section, as applicable, to the contribution on 
a timely filed original return (including extensions) or an amended 
return filed no later than July 18, 2017.

Par. 11. Section 1.721(c)-2T is removed.

0
Par. 12. Section 1.721(c)-3 is added to read as follows:


Sec.  1.721(c)-3  Gain deferral method.

    (a) Scope. This section describes the gain deferral method to avoid 
the immediate recognition of gain upon a contribution of section 721(c) 
property to a section 721(c) partnership. Paragraph (b) of this section 
provides the requirements of the gain deferral method, including the 
requirement to apply the consistent allocation method. Paragraph (c) of 
this section describes the consistent allocation method. Paragraph (d) 
of this section provides rules for tiered partnerships. Paragraph (e) 
of this section provides the dates of applicability. For definitions 
that apply for purposes of this section, see Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b).
    (b) Requirements of the gain deferral method. A contribution of 
section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership that would be 
subject to Sec.  1.721(c)-2(b) will not be subject to Sec.  1.721(c)-
2(b) if the conditions in paragraphs (b)(1) through (5) of this section 
are satisfied with respect to that property.
    (1) Either--
    (i) Both--
    (A) The section 721(c) partnership adopts the remedial allocation 
method described in Sec.  1.704-3(d) with respect to the section 721(c) 
property; and
    (B) The section 721(c) partnership applies the consistent 
allocation method provided in paragraph (c) of this section; or
    (ii) For the period beginning on the date of the contribution of 
the section 721(c) property and ending on the date on which there is no 
remaining built-in gain with respect to that property, all distributive 
shares of income and gain with respect to the section 721(c) property 
for all direct and indirect partners that are related foreign persons 
with respect to the U.S. transferor will be subject to taxation as 
income effectively connected with a trade or business within the United 
States (under either section 871 or 882), and neither the section 
721(c) partnership nor a related foreign person that is a direct or 
indirect partner in the section 721(c) partnership claims benefits 
under an income tax convention that would exempt the income or gain 
from tax or reduce the rate of taxation to which the income or gain is 
subject.
    (2) Upon an acceleration event, the U.S. transferor recognizes an 
amount of gain equal to the remaining built-in gain with respect to the 
section 721(c) property or an amount of gain required to be recognized 
under Sec.  1.721(c)-5(d) or (e), as applicable.
    (3) The procedural and reporting requirements provided in Sec.  
1.721(c)-6(b) are satisfied.
    (4) The U.S. transferor consents to extend the period of 
limitations on assessment of tax as required by Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)(5).
    (5) If the section 721(c) property is a partnership interest or 
property described in the partnership look-through rule provided in 
Sec.  1.721(c)-2(d), the applicable tiered-partnership rules provided 
in paragraph (d) of this section are applied.
    (c) Consistent allocation method--(1) In general. For each taxable 
year of a section 721(c) partnership in which there is remaining built-
in gain in the section 721(c) property, the section 721(c) partnership 
must allocate each book item of income, gain, deduction, and loss with 
respect to the section 721(c) property to the U.S. transferor in the 
same percentage. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(1), upon a 
variation (as defined in Sec.  1.706-4(a)(1)) of a U.S. transferor's 
interest in a section 721(c) partnership, a book item of income, gain, 
deduction, and loss with respect to a section 721(c) property is 
treated as allocated in the same percentage if the item is allocated 
under the interim closing method (as described in Sec.  1.706-4), 
unless the variation results from a transaction undertaken with a 
principal purpose of avoiding the tax consequences of the gain deferral 
method. For exceptions to the first sentence in this paragraph (c)(1), 
see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (2) Determining income or gain with respect to section 721(c) 
property. For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a 
section 721(c) partnership must attribute book income and gain to each 
item of section 721(c) property in a consistent manner using any 
reasonable method taking into account all the facts and circumstances. 
All items of book income and gain attributable to an item of section 
721(c) property will comprise a single class of gross income for 
purposes of applying paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (3) Determining deduction or loss with respect to section 721(c) 
property. For purposes of applying paragraph (c)(1) of this section, a 
section 721(c) partnership must use the principles of Sec. Sec.  1.861-
8 and 1.861-8T to allocate and apportion its items of deduction, except 
for interest expense and research and experimental expenditures, and 
loss to the class of gross income with respect to each item of section 
721(c) property as determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. 
Accordingly, a deduction or loss will be considered to be definitely 
related and therefore allocable to a class of gross income with respect 
to particular section 721(c) property whether or not there is any item 
of gross income in that class that is received or accrued during the 
taxable year and whether or not the amount of deduction or loss exceeds 
the amount of gross income in that class during the taxable year. If a 
deduction or loss is definitely related and therefore allocable to 
gross income attributable to more than one class of gross income of the 
section 721(c) partnership or if a deduction or loss is not definitely 
related to any class of gross income of the section 721(c) partnership, 
the section 721(c) partnership must apportion that

[[Page 3843]]

deduction or loss among its classes of gross income using a reasonable 
method that reflects to a reasonably close extent the factual 
relationship between the deduction or loss and the classes of gross 
income. The section 721(c) partnership may allocate and apportion its 
interest expense and research and experimental expenditures under any 
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, the methods 
prescribed in Sec. Sec.  1.861-9 and 1.861-9T (interest expense) and 
Sec.  1.861-17 (research and experimental expenditures). For purposes 
of this paragraph (c)(3), the section 721(c) partnership must allocate 
and apportion its deductions and losses without regard to the partners' 
percentage interests in the partnership.
    (4) Exceptions to the consistent allocation method--(i) Regulatory 
allocations. A regulatory allocation (as defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-
1(b)(10)) of book income, gain, deduction, or loss with respect to 
section 721(c) property that otherwise would fail to satisfy paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section is nevertheless deemed to satisfy paragraph 
(c)(1) of this section if the allocation is--
    (A) An allocation of income or gain to the U.S. transferor (or a 
member of its consolidated group as defined in Sec.  1.1502-1(h));
    (B) An allocation of deduction or loss to a partner other than the 
U.S. transferor (or a member of its consolidated group); or
    (C) Treated as a partial acceleration event pursuant to Sec.  
1.721(c)-5(d)(2).
    (ii) Allocation of creditable foreign tax expenditures. An 
allocation of a creditable foreign tax expenditure (as defined in Sec.  
1.704-1(b)(4)(viii)(b)) is not subject to the consistent allocation 
method.
    (d) Tiered partnership rules. This paragraph (d) provides the 
tiered partnership rules referred to in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section.
    (1) Section 721(c) property is a partnership interest. If the 
section 721(c) property that is contributed to a section 721(c) 
partnership is an interest in a partnership (lower-tier partnership), 
then the lower-tier partnership, if it is a controlled partnership with 
respect to the U.S. transferor, and each partnership in which an 
interest is owned (directly or indirectly through one or more 
partnerships) by the lower-tier partnership and that is a controlled 
partnership with respect to the U.S. transferor, must satisfy the 
requirements of paragraphs (d)(1)(i), (ii), and (iii) of this section.
    (i) The partnership must revalue all its property under Sec.  
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f)(6) if the revaluation would result in a separate 
positive difference between book value and adjusted tax basis in at 
least one property that is not excluded property.
    (ii) The partnership must apply the gain deferral method for each 
property (other than excluded property) for which there is a separate 
positive difference between book value and adjusted tax basis resulting 
from the revaluation described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (new 
positive reverse section 704(c) layer). If the partnership has 
previously adopted a section 704(c) method other than the remedial 
allocation method for the property, the partnership satisfies the 
requirement of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A) of this section by adopting the 
remedial allocation method for the new positive reverse section 704(c) 
layer.
    (iii) The partnership must treat a partner that is a partnership in 
which the U.S. transferor is a direct or indirect partner as if it were 
the U.S. transferor with respect to the section 721(c) property solely 
for purposes of applying the consistent allocation method.
    (2) Section 721(c) property is indirectly contributed by a U.S. 
transferor under the partnership look-through rule. If the U.S. 
transferor is a direct or indirect partner in the upper-tier 
partnership described in Sec.  1.721(c)-2(d)(1), and under Sec.  
1.721(c)-2(d)(1), the U.S. transferor is treated as contributing the 
section 721(c) property (including an interest in a partnership 
described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) to a section 721(c) 
partnership, then the requirements of paragraphs (d)(2)(i), (ii), and 
(iii) of this section must be satisfied.
    (i) The section 721(c) partnership must treat the upper-tier 
partnership as the U.S. transferor of the section 721(c) property 
solely for purposes of applying the consistent allocation method;
    (ii) The upper-tier partnership, if it is a controlled partnership 
with respect to the U.S. transferor, must apply the gain deferral 
method to its interest in the section 721(c) partnership; and
    (iii) If the U.S. transferor is an indirect partner in the upper-
tier partnership through one or more partnerships, the principles of 
paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section must be applied with 
respect to those partnerships that are controlled partnerships with 
respect to the U.S. transferor.
    (e) Applicability dates--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (e)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies to 
contributions occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and to 
contributions that occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an 
entity classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this 
chapter that was effective on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on 
or after August 6, 2015.
    (2) Certain provisions. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of 
this section, paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (c)(2) and (3), (c)(4)(i) and 
(ii), and (d)(1) and (2) of this section apply to contributions 
occurring on or after January 18, 2017, and to contributions that 
occurred before January 18, 2017 resulting from an entity 
classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter 
that was effective on or before January 18, 2017 but was filed on or 
after January 18, 2017. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this 
section, the second sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section 
applies to contributions occurring on or after January 17, 2020.
    (3) Election to apply the provisions described in paragraph (e)(2) 
of this section retroactively. Paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (c)(2) and (3), 
(c)(4)(i) and (ii), and (d)(1) and (2) of this section may, by 
election, be applied to a contribution that occurred on or after August 
6, 2015 but before January 18, 2017, and to a contribution that 
occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity classification 
election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective 
on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on or after August 6, 2015. 
The election described in the preceding sentence must have been made by 
applying paragraph (b)(1)(ii), (c)(2) or (3), (c)(4)(i) or (ii), or 
(d)(1) or (2) of this section, as applicable, to the contribution on a 
timely filed original return (including extensions) or an amended 
return filed no later than July 18, 2017. In order to elect to apply 
paragraph (c)(2) or (3) of this section to a contribution described in 
this paragraph (e)(3), an election must also have been made to apply 
paragraph (c)(3) or (2) of this section, respectively, to the 
contribution. The second sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, 
may, by election, be applied to a contribution that occurred on or 
after August 6, 2015 but before January 17, 2020, and to a contribution 
that occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity 
classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter 
that was effective on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on or 
after August 6, 2015. The election described in the preceding sentence 
must be made by applying the second sentence of paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section to the contribution on a timely filed original return 
(including extensions) or an amended return filed no later than July 
17, 2020.
    (4) Transitional rules. If a contribution is described in paragraph 
(e)(2) of this section and no election

[[Page 3844]]

described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section is made to apply one or 
more of paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) and (c)(4)(i) and (ii) of this 
section, as applicable, to the contribution, then, for purposes of 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the section 721(c) partnership must 
attribute book income, gain, loss, and deduction to the section 721(c) 
property in a consistent manner under any reasonable method taking into 
account all the facts and circumstances. If a contribution is described 
in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and no election described in 
paragraph (e)(3) of this section is made to apply paragraph (d)(1) or 
(2) of this section, as applicable, to the contribution, then, this 
section must be applied in a manner consistent with the purpose of the 
section 721(c) regulations. Thus, for example, if a U.S. transferor is 
a direct or indirect partner in a partnership and that partnership 
contributes section 721(c) property to a lower-tier partnership, or, if 
a U.S. transferor contributes an interest in a partnership that owns 
section 721(c) property to a lower-tier partnership, then paragraph (b) 
of this section applies as though the U.S. transferor contributed its 
share of the section 721(c) property directly.

of this section defines an acceleration event. Paragraph (c) of this 
section provides the consequences of an acceleration event. Paragraph 
(d) of this section provides the dates of applicability. For 
definitions that apply for purposes of this section, see Sec.  
1.721(c)-1(b).
    (b) Definition of an acceleration event--(1) General rules. Except 
as provided in this paragraph (b) and Sec.  1.721(c)-5 (acceleration 
event exceptions), an acceleration event with respect to section 721(c) 
property is any event that either would reduce the amount of remaining 
built-in gain that a U.S. transferor would recognize under the gain 
deferral method if the event had not occurred or could defer the 
recognition of the remaining built-in gain. An acceleration event 
includes a contribution of section 721(c) property to another 
partnership by a section 721(c) partnership and a contribution of an 
interest in a section 721(c) partnership to another partnership. This 
paragraph (b) applies on a property-by-property basis.
    (2) Failure to comply with a requirement of the gain deferral 
method--(i) General rule. An acceleration event with respect to section 
721(c) property occurs when any party fails to comply with a condition 
of the gain deferral method with respect to the section 721(c) 
property.
    (ii) Certain failures to comply with procedural and reporting 
requirements. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section, an 
acceleration event will not occur solely as a result of a failure to 
comply with a requirement of Sec.  1.721(c)-3(b)(3) that is not 
willful. See Sec. Sec.  1.721(c)-6(f) and 1.6038B-2(h)(3).
    (3) Lower-tier partnership allocations. Notwithstanding paragraph 
(b)(1) of this section, an acceleration event will not occur because of 
a reduction in remaining built-in gain in an interest in a partnership 
that is section 721(c) property that occurs as a result of allocations 
of book items of deduction and loss, or tax items of income and gain.
    (4) Deemed acceleration event. A U.S. transferor may treat an 
acceleration event as having occurred with respect to section 721(c) 
property by both recognizing gain in an amount equal to the remaining 
built-in gain that would have been allocated to the U.S. transferor if 
the section 721(c) partnership had sold the section 721(c) property 
immediately before the deemed acceleration event for fair market value 
and satisfying the reporting required by Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)(3)(i)(D). 
In this case, see paragraph (c) of this section regarding basis 
adjustments.
    (c) Consequences of an acceleration event. Paragraphs (c)(1) and 
(2) of this section provide the consequences of an acceleration event 
with respect to section 721(c) property, a partial acceleration event 
with respect to section 721(c) property to the extent provided in Sec.  
1.721(c)-5(d)(1), and a transfer described in section 367 of section 
721(c) property to the extent provided in Sec.  1.721(c)-5(e).
    (1) U.S. transferor. The U.S. transferor must recognize gain in an 
amount equal to the remaining built-in gain that would have been 
allocated to the U.S. transferor if the section 721(c) partnership had 
sold the section 721(c) property immediately before the acceleration 
event for fair market value. The U.S. transferor will increase its 
basis in its partnership interest by the amount of gain recognized. If 
the U.S. transferor is an indirect partner in the section 721(c) 
partnership through one or more tiered partnerships, appropriate basis 
adjustments will be made to the interests in the tiered partnerships.
    (2) Section 721(c) partnership. The section 721(c) partnership will 
increase its basis in the section 721(c) property by the amount of 
built-in gain recognized by the U.S. transferor under paragraph (c)(1) 
of this section. Any tax consequences of the acceleration event will be 
determined taking into account the increase in the partnership's 
adjusted tax basis in the section 721(c) property. If the section 
721(c) property remains in the partnership after the acceleration 
event, the increase in basis of the section 721(c) property may be 
recovered using any applicable recovery period and depreciation (or 
other cost recovery) method (including first-year conventions) 
available to the partnership for newly purchased property of the same 
type placed in service on the date of the acceleration event. The 
section 721(c) property will no longer be subject to the gain deferral 
method.
    (d) Applicability dates. This section applies to contributions 
occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and to contributions that 
occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity classification 
election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective 
on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on or after August 6, 2015.

Par. 15. Section 1.721(c)-4T is removed.

0
Par. 16. Section 1.721(c)-5 is added to read as follows:


Sec.  1.721(c)-5  Acceleration event exceptions.

    (a) Scope. This section identifies exceptions to the acceleration 
events, which, like the rules regarding acceleration events provided in 
Sec.  1.721(c)-4(b), apply on a property-by-property basis. Paragraph 
(b) of this section identifies the events that terminate the 
requirement to apply the gain deferral method. Paragraph (c) of this 
section identifies the successor events that allow for the continued 
application of the gain deferral method. Paragraph (d) of this section 
identifies the partial acceleration events. Paragraph (e) of this 
section provides special rules for transfers of section 721(c) property 
to a foreign corporation described in section 367. Paragraph (f) of 
this section allows for the continued application of the gain deferral 
method if there is a fully taxable disposition of a portion of an 
interest in a partnership. Paragraph (g) of this section provides the 
dates of applicability. For

[[Page 3845]]

definitions that apply for purposes of this section, see Sec.  
1.721(c)-1(b).
    (b) Termination events--(1) In general. Notwithstanding Sec.  
1.721(c)-4(b)(1), a termination event with respect to section 721(c) 
property will not constitute an acceleration event. In these cases, the 
section 721(c) property will no longer be subject to the gain deferral 
method.
    (2) Transfers of section 721(c) property (other than a partnership 
interest) to a domestic corporation described in section 351. A 
termination event occurs if a section 721(c) partnership transfers 
section 721(c) property (other than an interest in a partnership) to a 
domestic corporation in a transaction to which section 351 applies.
    (3) Certain incorporations of a section 721(c) partnership. A 
termination event occurs upon an incorporation of a section 721(c) 
partnership into a domestic corporation by any method of incorporation 
(other than a method involving an actual distribution of partnership 
property to the partners, followed by a contribution of that property 
to a corporation), provided that the section 721(c) partnership is 
liquidated as part of the incorporation transaction.
    (4) Certain distributions of section 721(c) property. A termination 
event occurs if a section 721(c) partnership distributes section 721(c) 
property either to the U.S. transferor or, if the U.S. transferor is a 
member of a consolidated group (as defined in Sec.  1.1502-1(h)) at the 
time of the distribution and the distribution occurs outside the seven-
year period described in section 704(c)(1)(B), to a member of the 
consolidated group.
    (5) Partnership ceases to have a partner that is a related foreign 
person. A termination event occurs when a section 721(c) partnership 
ceases to have any direct or indirect partners that are related foreign 
persons with respect to the U.S. transferor, provided there is no plan 
for a related foreign person to subsequently become a direct or 
indirect partner in the partnership (or a successor). This paragraph 
(b)(5) does not apply to a distribution of section 721(c) property in 
redemption of a related foreign person's interest in a section 721(c) 
partnership.
    (6) Fully taxable dispositions of section 721(c) property. A 
termination event occurs if a section 721(c) partnership disposes of 
section 721(c) property in a transaction in which all gain or loss, if 
any, is recognized.
    (7) Fully taxable dispositions of an entire interest in a section 
721(c) partnership. A termination event occurs if a U.S. transferor or 
a partnership in which a U.S. transferor is a direct or indirect 
partner disposes of its entire interest in a section 721(c) partnership 
that owns the section 721(c) property in a transaction in which all 
gain or loss, if any, is recognized. This paragraph (b)(7) does not 
apply if a U.S. transferor is a member of a consolidated group (as 
defined in Sec.  1.1502-1(h)) and the interest in the section 721(c) 
partnership is transferred in an intercompany transaction (as defined 
in Sec.  1.1502-13(b)(1)); see paragraph (c)(3) of this section for a 
successor event rule applicable to these intercompany transactions.
    (c) Successor events--(1) In general. Notwithstanding Sec.  
1.721(c)-4(b)(1), a successor event with respect to section 721(c) 
property will not constitute an acceleration event. If a portion of an 
interest in a partnership is transferred in a successor event described 
in this paragraph (c), the principles of Sec.  1.704-3(a)(7) apply to 
determine the remaining built-in gain in section 721(c) property that 
is attributable to the portion of the interest that is transferred and 
the portion of the interest that is retained.
    (2) Transfers of an interest in a section 721(c) partnership by a 
U.S. transferor or upper-tier partnership to a domestic corporation in 
certain nonrecognition transactions. A successor event occurs if a U.S. 
transferor or a partnership in which a U.S. transferor is a direct or 
indirect partner transfers (directly or indirectly through one or more 
partnerships) an interest in a section 721(c) partnership to a domestic 
corporation in a transaction to which section 351 or 381 applies, and 
the gain deferral method is continued by treating the transferee 
domestic corporation as the U.S. transferor for purposes of the section 
721(c) regulations. If the transfer described in this paragraph (c)(2) 
also results in a termination under section 708(b)(1)(B) of the section 
721(c) partnership, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (3) Transfers of an interest in a section 721(c) partnership in an 
intercompany transaction. A successor event occurs if a U.S. transferor 
that is a member of a consolidated group (as defined in Sec.  1.1502-
1(h)) transfers (directly or indirectly through one or more 
partnerships) an interest in a section 721(c) partnership in an 
intercompany transaction (as defined in Sec.  1.1502-13(b)(1)), and the 
gain deferral method is continued by treating the transferee member as 
the U.S. transferor for purposes of the section 721(c) regulations. If 
the transfer described in this paragraph (c)(3) also results in a 
termination under section 708(b)(1)(B) of the section 721(c) 
partnership, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section.
    (4) Termination under section 708(b)(1)(B) of a section 721(c) 
partnership. A successor event occurs if there is a termination under 
section 708(b)(1)(B) of a section 721(c) partnership, and the gain 
deferral method is continued by treating the new partnership as the 
section 721(c) partnership for purposes of the section 721(c) 
regulations.
    (5) Transactions involving tiered partnerships--(i) Contributions 
of section 721(c) property to a lower-tier partnership. A successor 
event occurs if a section 721(c) partnership contributes the section 
721(c) property to a partnership that is a controlled partnership with 
respect to the U.S. transferor (lower-tier section 721(c) partnership) 
and the requirements of paragraphs (c)(5)(i)(A) through (C) of this 
section are satisfied.
    (A) The lower-tier section 721(c) partnership is a section 721(c) 
partnership or is treated as a section 721(c) partnership.
    (B) The gain deferral method is applied with respect to the section 
721(c) property in the hands of the lower-tier section 721(c) 
partnership.
    (C) The gain deferral method is applied with respect to the section 
721(c) partnership's interest in the lower-tier section 721(c) 
partnership. See Sec.  1.721(c)-3(b)(5) and (d)(2).
    (ii) Contributions of an interest in a section 721(c) partnership 
to an upper-tier partnership. A successor event occurs if a U.S. 
transferor or a partnership in which a U.S. transferor is a direct or 
indirect partner contributes (directly or indirectly through one or 
more partnerships) an interest in a section 721(c) partnership to a 
partnership that is a controlled partnership with respect to the U.S. 
transferor (upper-tier section 721(c) partnership) and the requirements 
of paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(A) through (D) of this section are satisfied.
    (A) The gain deferral method is continued with respect to the 
section 721(c) property in the hands of the section 721(c) partnership.
    (B) The upper-tier section 721(c) partnership is, or is treated as, 
a section 721(c) partnership.
    (C) If the upper-tier section 721(c) partnership directly owns its 
interest in the section 721(c) partnership, the gain deferral method is 
applied with respect to the upper-tier section 721(c) partnership's 
interest in the section 721(c) partnership. See Sec.  1.721(c)-3(b)(5) 
and (d)(1).

[[Page 3846]]

    (D) If the upper-tier section 721(c) partnership indirectly owns 
its interest in the section 721(c) partnership through one or more 
partnerships, the principles of paragraphs (c)(5)(ii)(B) and (C) of 
this section are applied with respect to each partnership through which 
the upper-tier section 721(c) partnership indirectly owns an interest 
in the section 721(c) partnership.
    (d) Partial acceleration events--(1) In general. Notwithstanding 
Sec.  1.721(c)-4, a partial acceleration event with respect to section 
721(c) property does not constitute an acceleration event. In these 
cases, except as provided in paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the 
rules in Sec.  1.721(c)-4(c) (concerning the consequences of an 
acceleration event) for making basis adjustments apply to the extent 
that the U.S. transferor is required to recognize gain under paragraph 
(d)(2) or (3) of this section. Furthermore, if there is remaining 
built-in gain with respect to the section 721(c) property after the 
application of this paragraph (d), the application of the gain deferral 
method with respect to the section 721(c) property must be continued in 
the same manner.
    (2) Regulatory allocations. If a regulatory allocation is described 
in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(c)(4)(i) but not in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(c)(4)(i)(A) or 
(B), a partial acceleration event occurs with respect to section 721(c) 
property if the U.S. transferor recognizes an amount of gain (but not 
in excess of remaining built-in gain) equal to the amount of the 
allocation that, under the consistent allocation method, had the 
regulatory allocation not occurred, would have been allocated to the 
U.S. transferor in the case of income or gain, or would not have been 
allocated to the U.S. transferor in the case of deduction or loss.
    (3) Certain distributions of other partnership property to a 
partner that result in an adjustment under section 734. A partial 
acceleration event occurs with respect to section 721(c) property if 
there is a distribution of other property by the section 721(c) 
partnership that results in a positive basis adjustment to the section 
721(c) property under section 734. In these cases, the U.S. transferor 
must recognize an amount of gain (but not in excess of the remaining 
built-in gain) equal to the positive basis adjustment to the section 
721(c) property under section 734, reduced (but not below zero) by the 
amount of gain recognized by the U.S. transferor (or a member of its 
consolidated group (as defined in Sec.  1.1502-1(h))) under section 
731(a). In these cases, the partnership will not increase its basis 
under Sec.  1.721(c)-4(c)(2) by the amount of gain recognized by the 
U.S. transferor.
    (e) Transfers described in section 367 of section 721(c) property 
to a foreign corporation. If a section 721(c) partnership transfers 
section 721(c) property, or a U.S. transferor or a partnership in which 
a U.S. transferor is a direct or indirect partner transfers (directly 
or indirectly through one or more partnerships) all or a portion of an 
interest in a section 721(c) partnership that owns section 721(c) 
property, to a foreign corporation in a transaction described in 
section 367, then the property will no longer be subject to the gain 
deferral method. To the extent any U.S. transferor is treated as 
transferring the section 721(c) property to the foreign corporation for 
purposes of section 367, the tax consequences will be determined under 
section 367. In this regard, see Sec. Sec.  1.367(a)-1T(c)(3)(i) and 
(ii), 1.367(d)-1T(d)(1), and 1.367(e)-2(b)(1)(iii) (providing for the 
aggregate treatment of partnerships). However, for the remaining 
portion of the property (if any), the U.S. transferor must recognize an 
amount of gain equal to the remaining built-in gain that would have 
been allocated to the U.S. transferor if the section 721(c) partnership 
had sold that portion of the section 721(c) property immediately before 
the transfer for fair market value. The stock in the transferee foreign 
corporation received will not be subject to the gain deferral method. 
The rules in Sec.  1.721(c)-4(c) (concerning the consequences of an 
acceleration event) for making basis adjustments will apply to the 
extent that the U.S. transferor recognizes gain under this paragraph 
(e).
    (f) Fully taxable dispositions of a portion of an interest in a 
partnership. If a U.S. transferor or a partnership in which a U.S. 
transferor is a direct or indirect partner disposes of (directly or 
indirectly through one or more partnerships) a portion of an interest 
in a section 721(c) partnership in a transaction in which all gain or 
loss, if any, is recognized, an acceleration event will not occur with 
respect to the portion of the interest transferred. The gain deferral 
method will continue to apply with respect to the section 721(c) 
property of the section 721(c) partnership. The principles of Sec.  
1.704-3(a)(7) will apply to determine the remaining built-in gain in 
section 721(c) property that is attributable to the portion of the 
interest in a section 721(c) partnership that is retained. This 
paragraph (f) will not apply to an intercompany transaction (as defined 
in Sec.  1.1502-13(b)(1)).
    (g) Applicability dates--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraph (g)(2) of this section, this section applies to contributions 
occurring on or after January 18, 2017, and to contributions that 
occurred before January 18, 2017 resulting from an entity 
classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter 
that was effective on or before January 18, 2017 but was filed on or 
after January 18, 2017.
    (2) Election to apply this section retroactively. This section may, 
by election, be applied to a contribution that occurred on or after 
August 6, 2015 but before January 18, 2017, and to a contribution that 
occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity classification 
election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective 
on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on or after August 6, 2015. 
The election must have been made by applying this section to the 
contribution on a timely filed original return (including extensions) 
or an amended return filed no later than July 18, 2017.

applicable);
    (F) A description of all transfers of section 721(c) property to a 
foreign corporation described in Sec.  1.721(c)-5(e) that occurred 
during the taxable year, and for each transfer, the date of the 
transfer, the section 721(c) property transferred, and the name, 
address, and U.S. taxpayer identification number (if any) of the 
foreign transferee corporation; and
    (G) With respect to section 721(c) property for which a waiver of 
treaty benefits was filed under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, 
a declaration that, after exercising reasonable diligence, to the best 
of the U.S. transferor's knowledge and belief, all income from the 
section 721(c) property allocated to the partners during the taxable 
year remained subject to taxation as income effectively connected with 
the conduct of a trade or business within the United States (under 
either section 871 or 882) for all direct or indirect partners that are 
related foreign persons with respect to the U.S. transferor (regardless 
of whether any such partner was a partner at the time of the gain 
deferral contribution), and, that neither the partnership nor any such 
partner has made any claim under any income tax convention to an 
exemption from U.S. income tax or a reduced rate of U.S. income 
taxation on income derived from the use of the section 721(c) property;
    (ii) On Form 8838-P, an extension of the period of limitations on 
the assessment of tax, in the case of a gain deferral contribution, as 
described in paragraph (b)(5)(ii) of this section, and, in the case of 
certain contributions on which gain is recognized, as described in 
paragraph (b)(5)(iii) of this section;
    (iii) If the section 721(c) partnership is a partnership that does 
not have a filing obligation under section 6031, the information 
described in Sec.  1.6038-3(g) (contents of information returns 
required of certain United States persons with respect to controlled 
foreign partnerships), if not already reported elsewhere, without 
regard to whether the section 721(c) partnership is a controlled 
foreign partnership within the meaning of section 6038. If the U.S. 
transferor is not a controlling fifty-percent partner (as defined in 
Sec.  1.6038-3(a)), the U.S. transferor complies with the requirement 
of this paragraph (b)(3)(iii) by providing the information described in 
Sec.  1.6038-3(g)(1);

[[Page 3848]]

    (iv) On Schedule O (Form 8865), a description of all section 721(c) 
property contributed by the U.S. transferor to the section 721(c) 
partnership (including pursuant to a contribution described in Sec.  
1.721(c)-2(d)(1)) during the taxable year to which the gain deferral 
method is not applied; and
    (v) The information required in paragraphs (c)(2) and (3) of this 
section for related foreign persons that are direct or indirect 
partners in the section 721(c) partnership and the section 721(c) 
partnership itself (if any).
    (4) Domestic partnerships treated as foreign. Solely for purposes 
of this section, a U.S. transferor must treat a domestic section 721(c) 
partnership as a foreign partnership if the partnership was formed on 
or after January 18, 2017. If the section 721(c) partnership has an 
information return filing obligation under section 6031, that 
requirement is not affected by the requirement of this paragraph (b)(4) 
that the U.S. transferor treat the partnership as a foreign 
partnership.
    (5) Extension of period of limitations on assessment of tax. In 
order to comply with the gain deferral method, a U.S. transferor must 
extend the period of limitations on the assessment of tax using Form 
8838-P:
    (i) With respect to the gain realized but not recognized on a gain 
deferral contribution, through the date that is 96 months after the 
close of the U.S. transferor's taxable year that includes the date of 
the gain deferral contribution;
    (ii) With respect to all book and tax items with respect to the 
section 721(c) property allocated to the U.S. transferor in the 
partnership's taxable year that includes the date of the gain deferral 
contribution and the subsequent two years, through the date that is 72 
months after the close of such taxable year with which, or within 
which, the partnership's taxable year ends; and
    (iii) With respect to the gain recognized on a contribution of 
section 721(c) property to a section 721(c) partnership for which the 
gain deferral method is not applied, if the contribution occurs within 
five partnership taxable years following a partnership taxable year 
that includes the date of a gain deferral contribution, through the 
date that is 60 months after the close of the U.S. transferor's taxable 
year that includes the date of the contribution on which gain is 
recognized.
    (c) Information with respect to section 721(c) partnerships and 
related foreign persons--(1) Effectively connected income. If the gain 
deferral method is applied with respect to a contribution of section 
721(c) property that satisfies the condition in Sec.  1.721(c)-
3(b)(1)(ii), the U.S. transferor must obtain a statement from the 
section 721(c) partnership and from each related foreign person that is 
a direct or indirect partner in the section 721(c) partnership, titled 
``Statement of Waiver of Treaty Benefits under Sec.  1.721(c)-6,'' 
pursuant to which the partner and the partnership waive any claim under 
any income tax convention (whether or not currently in force at the 
time of the contribution) to an exemption from U.S. income tax or a 
reduced rate of U.S. income taxation on income derived from the use of 
the section 721(c) property for the period during which the section 
721(c) property is subject to the gain deferral method.
    (2) Partnerships in tiered-partnership structures applying the gain 
deferral method. If the gain deferral method is applied as a result of 
a transaction described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d), the U.S. transferor 
must supply all the information that a section 721(c) partnership would 
be required to report under paragraph (b) of this section if the 
section 721(c) partnership were a U.S. transferor.
    (3) Schedules K-1 for related foreign partners. If a section 721(c) 
partnership does not have a filing obligation under section 6031, the 
U.S. transferor must obtain a Schedule K-1 (Form 8865), Partner's Share 
of Income, Deduction, Credits, etc., for all related foreign persons 
that are direct or indirect partners in the section 721(c) partnership.
    (d) Reporting and procedural requirements of a section 721(c) 
partnership with a section 6031 filing obligation--(1) Waiver of treaty 
benefits. A section 721(c) partnership with a return filing obligation 
under section 6031 must include its waiver of treaty benefits described 
in paragraph (c)(1) of this section with its tax return for the taxable 
year that includes the date of the gain deferral contribution.
    (2) Information on Schedule K-1. A section 721(c) partnership with 
a return filing obligation under section 6031 must provide the relevant 
information necessary for the U.S. transferor to comply with the 
requirements in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section (using the 
Forms and Schedules specified in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this 
section) with the U.S. transferor's Schedule K-1 (Form 1065), Partner's 
Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc. The partnership must also 
attach a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) to its Form 1065 for each direct or 
indirect partner that is a related foreign person with respect to the 
U.S. transferor.
    (e) Signatory. Any statements required in this section must be 
signed under penalties of perjury by an agent of the U.S. transferor, 
the related foreign person that is a direct or indirect partner in the 
section 721(c) partnership, or the section 721(c) partnership, as 
applicable, that is authorized to sign under a general or specific 
power of attorney, or by an appropriate party. For the U.S. transferor, 
an appropriate party is a person described in Sec.  1.367(a)-8(e)(1). 
For a partnership with a section 6031 filing obligation, an appropriate 
party is any party authorized to sign Form 1065.
    (f) Relief for certain failures to file or failures to comply that 
are not willful--(1) In general. This paragraph (f)(1) provides relief 
from the failure to comply with the procedural and reporting 
requirements of the gain deferral method prescribed by Sec.  1.721(c)-
3(b)(3) and provided in paragraph (b) of this section if there is a 
failure to file or to include information required by this section 
(failure to comply). A failure to comply will be deemed not to have 
occurred for purposes of Sec.  1.721(c)-3(b)(3) if the U.S. transferor 
demonstrates that the failure was not willful using the procedure 
provided in this paragraph (f). For purposes of this paragraph (f), 
willful is to be interpreted consistent with the meaning of that term 
in the context of other civil penalties, which would include a failure 
due to gross negligence, reckless disregard, or willful neglect. 
Whether a failure to comply was willful will be determined by the 
Director of Field Operations, Cross Border Activities Practice Area of 
Large Business & International (or any successor to the roles and 
responsibilities of such position, as appropriate) (Director) based on 
all the facts and circumstances. The U.S. transferor must submit a 
request for relief and an explanation as provided in paragraph (f)(2) 
of this section. A U.S. transferor whose failure to comply is 
determined not to be willful under this paragraph (f) will be subject 
to a penalty under section 6038B if it fails to satisfy the applicable 
reporting requirements under that section and does not demonstrate that 
the failure was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. See 
Sec.  1.6038B-2(h). The determination of whether the failure to comply 
was willful under this section has no effect on any request for relief 
made under Sec.  1.6038B-2(h).
    (2) Procedures for establishing that a failure to comply was not 
willful--(i) Time and manner of submission. A U.S.

[[Page 3849]]

transferor's statement that a failure to comply was not willful will be 
considered only if, promptly after the U.S. transferor becomes aware of 
the failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which 
the failure relates that includes the information that should have been 
included with the original return for such taxable year or that 
otherwise complies with the rules of this section as well as a written 
statement explaining the reasons for the failure to comply. The U.S. 
transferor also must file, with the amended return, a Schedule O (Form 
8865) and Form 8838-P (as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section), completed and executed as prescribed in forms and 
instructions, consenting to extend the period of limitations on 
assessment of tax with respect to the gain realized but not recognized 
on the gain deferral contribution to the later of the date that is 96 
months after the close of the U.S. transferor's taxable year that 
includes the date of the gain deferral contribution (date one), or the 
date that is 36 months after the date on which the required information 
is provided to the Director (date two). However, the U.S. transferor is 
not required to file a Schedule O (Form 8865), with the amended return 
if both date one is later than date two and a consent to extend the 
period of limitations on assessment of tax with respect to the gain 
realized but not recognized on the gain deferral contribution for the 
U.S. transferor's taxable year that includes the date of the 
contribution was previously submitted with a Schedule O (Form 8865). 
The amended return and either a Schedule O (Form 8865) or a copy of the 
previously filed Schedule O (Form 8865), as the case may be, must be 
filed with the Internal Revenue Service at the location where the U.S. 
transferor filed its original return. The U.S. transferor may submit a 
request for relief from the penalty under section 6038B as part of the 
same submission. See Sec.  1.6038B-2(h)(3).
    (ii) Notice requirement. In addition to the requirements of 
paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section, the U.S. transferor must comply 
with the notice requirements of this paragraph (f)(2)(ii). If any 
taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the 
amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return must be delivered 
to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the examination. 
If no taxable year of the U.S. transferor is under examination when the 
amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return must be delivered 
to the Director.
    (g) Applicability dates--(1) In general. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (g)(2) and (3) of this section, this section applies with 
respect to contributions occurring on or after January 18, 2017, and 
with respect to contributions that occurred before January 18, 2017 
resulting from an entity classification election made under Sec.  
301.7701-3 of this chapter that was effective on or before January 18, 
2017 but was filed on or after January 18, 2017.
    (2) Reporting relating to effectively connected income. Paragraphs 
(b)(2)(iii), (b)(3)(i)(G), and (d)(1) of this section apply to a 
contribution occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and to a 
contribution that occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an 
entity classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this 
chapter that was effective on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on 
or after August 6, 2015, and, in either case, provided Sec.  1.721(c)-
3(b)(1)(ii) applies to the contribution. To the extent that a 
previously filed return did not comply with paragraph (b)(2)(iii), 
(b)(3)(i)(G), or (d)(1) of this section, an amended return complying 
with such paragraphs must have been filed no later than July 18, 2017.
    (3) Transition rules--(i) Reporting under sections 6038, 6038B, and 
6046A. For transfers occurring on or after August 6, 2015, and for 
transfers that occurred before August 6, 2015 resulting from an entity 
classification election made under Sec.  301.7701-3 of this chapter 
that was effective on or before August 6, 2015 but was filed on or 
after August 6, 2015, a U.S. transferor (or a domestic partnership in 
which a U.S. transferor is a direct or indirect partner) must fulfill 
any reporting requirements imposed under sections 6038, 6038B, and 
6046A with respect to the contribution of the section 721(c) property 
to the section 721(c) partnership.
    (ii) Reporting using statements instead of prescribed forms and 
schedules. For tax returns filed before March 17, 2020, reporting that 
met the requirements of Sec.  1.721(c)-6T (see 26 CFR part 1, revised 
as of April 1, 2019) as in effect before January 1, 2020, will be 
deemed to satisfy the corresponding requirements of this section.

Par. 20. Section 1.721(c)-7 is added to read as follows:


Sec.  1.721(c)-7  Examples.

    (a) Presumed facts. For purposes of the examples in paragraph (b) 
of this section, assume that there are no other transactions that are 
related to the transactions described in the examples and that all 
partnership allocations have substantial economic effect under section 
704(b). For definitions that apply for purposes of this section, see 
Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b). Except where otherwise indicated, the following 
facts are presumed--
    (1) USP and USX are domestic corporations that each use a calendar 
taxable year. USX is not a related person with respect to USP.
    (2) CFC1, CFC2, FX, and FY are foreign corporations.
    (3) USP wholly owns CFC1 and CFC2. Neither FX nor FY is a related 
person with respect to USP or with respect to each other.
    (4) PRS1, PRS2, and PRS3 are foreign entities classified as 
partnerships for U.S. tax purposes. A partnership interest in PRS1, 
PRS2, and PRS3 is not described in section 475(c)(2).
    (5) A taxable year is referred to, for example, as year 1.
    (6) A partner in a partnership has the same percentage interest in 
income, gain, loss, deduction, and capital of the partnership.
    (7) No property is described in section 197(f)(9) in the hands of a 
contributing partner.
    (8) No partnership is a controlled partnership solely under the 
facts and circumstances test in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(4).
    (b) Examples. The application of the rules stated in Sec. Sec.  
1.721(c)-1 through 1.721(c)-6 may be illustrated by the following 
examples:

    (1) Example 1: Determining if a partnership is a section 721(c) 
partnership--(i) Facts. In year 1, USP and CFC1 form PRS1 as equal 
partners. CFC1 contributes cash of $1.5 million to PRS1, and USP 
contributes three properties to PRS1: A patent with a book value of 
$1.2 million and an adjusted tax basis of zero, a security (within 
the meaning of section 475(c)(2)) with a book value of $100,000 and 
an adjusted tax basis of $20,000, and a machine with a book value of 
$200,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $600,000.
    (ii) Results. (A) Under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(18)(i), USP is a 
U.S. transferor because USP is a U.S. person and not a domestic 
partnership. Under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(2), the patent has built-in 
gain of $1.2 million. The patent is not excluded property under 
Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(6). Therefore, under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(15)(i), 
the patent is section 721(c) property because it is property, other 
than excluded property, with built-in gain that is contributed by a 
U.S. transferor, USP.
    (B) Under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(2), the security has built-in gain 
of $80,000. Under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(6)(ii), the security is 
excluded property because it is described in section 475(c)(2). 
Therefore, the security is not section 721(c) property.
    (C) The tax basis of the machine exceeds its book value. Under 
Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(6)(iii), the machine is excluded property and 
therefore is not section 721(c) property.
    (D) Under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(12), CFC1 is a related person with 
respect to USP, and

[[Page 3850]]

under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(11), CFC1 is a related foreign person. 
Because USP and CFC1 collectively own at least 80 percent of the 
interests in the capital, profits, deductions, or losses of PRS1, 
under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(14)(i), PRS1 is a section 721(c) 
partnership upon the contribution by USP of the patent.
    (E) The de minimis exception described in Sec.  1.721(c)-2(c) 
does not apply to the contribution because during PRS1's year 1 the 
sum of the built-in gain with respect to all section 721(c) property 
contributed in year 1 to PRS1 is $1.2 million, which exceeds the de 
minimis threshold of $1 million. As a result, under Sec.  1.721(c)-
2(b), section 721(a) does not apply to USP's contribution of the 
patent to PRS1, unless the requirements of the gain deferral method 
are satisfied.
    (2) Example 2: Determining if partnership interest is section 
721(c) property--(i) Facts. In year 1, USP and FX form PRS2. USP 
contributes a security (within the meaning of section 475(c)(2)) 
with a book value of $100,000 and an adjusted tax basis of $20,000 
and a building located in country X with a book value of $30,000 and 
an adjusted tax basis of $8,000 in exchange for a 40-percent 
interest. FX contributes a machine with a book value of $195,000 and 
an adjusted tax basis of $250,000 in exchange for a 60-percent 
interest.
    (ii) Results. PRS2 is not a section 721(c) partnership because 
FX is not a related person with respect to USP. USP's contributions 
to PRS2 are not subject to Sec.  1.721(c)-2(b).
    (iii) Alternative facts and results. (A) The facts are the same 
as in paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section (the facts in Example 2). 
In addition, USP and CFC1 form PRS1 as equal partners. CFC1 
contributes cash of $130,000 to PRS1, and USP contributes its 40-
percent interest in PRS2.
    (B) PRS2's property consists of a security and a machine that 
are excluded property, and a building with built-in gain in excess 
of $20,000. Under Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(6)(iv), because more than 90 
percent of the value of the property of PRS2 consists of excluded 
property described in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(6)(i) through (iii) (the 
security and the machine), any interest in PRS2 is excluded 
property. Therefore, the 40-percent interest in PRS2 contributed by 
USP to PRS1 is not section 721(c) property. Accordingly, USP's 
contribution of its interest in PRS2 to PRS1 is not subject to Sec.  
1.721(c)-2(b).
    (3) Example 3: Assets-over tiered partnerships--(i) Facts. In 
year 1, USP and CFC1 form PRS1 as equal partners. USP contributes a 
patent with a book value of $300 million and an adjusted tax basis 
of $30 million (USP contribution). CFC1 contributes cash of $300 
million. Immediately thereafter, PRS1 contributes the patent to PRS2 
in exchange for a two-thirds interest (PRS1 contribution), and CFC2 
contributes cash of $150 million in exchange for a one-third 
interest. The patent has a remaining recovery period of 5 years out 
of a total of 15 years. With respect to all contributions described 
in Sec.  1.721(c)-2(b), the de minimis exception does not apply, and 
the gain deferral method is applied. Thus, the partnership 
agreements of PRS1 and PRS2 provide that the partnership will make 
allocations under section 704(c) using the remedial allocation 
method under Sec.  1.704-3(d).
    (ii) Results: USP contribution. PRS1 is a section 721(c) 
partnership as a result of the USP contribution.
    (iii) Results: PRS1 contribution. (A) For purposes of 
determining whether PRS2 is a section 721(c) partnership as a result 
of the PRS1 contribution, under Sec.  1.721(c)-2(d)(1), USP is 
treated as contributing to PRS2 its share of the patent that PRS1 
actually contributes to PRS2. USP and CFC1 are each one-third 
indirect partners in PRS2. Taking into account the one-third 
interest in PRS2 directly owned by CFC2, USP, CFC1, and CFC2 
collectively own at least 80 percent of the interests in PRS2. Thus, 
PRS2 is a section 721(c) partnership as a result of the PRS1 
contribution.
    (B) Under Sec.  1.721(c)-2(b), section 721(a) does not apply to 
PRS1's contribution of the patent to PRS2, unless the requirements 
of the gain deferral method are satisfied. Under Sec.  1.721(c)-
3(b), the gain deferral method must be applied with respect to the 
patent. In addition, under Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d)(2), because PRS1 is a 
controlled partnership with respect to USP, the gain deferral method 
must be applied with respect to PRS1's interest in PRS2, and, solely 
for purposes of applying the consistent allocation method, PRS2 must 
treat PRS1 as the U.S. transferor. As stated in paragraph (b)(3)(i) 
of this section (the facts in Example 3), the gain deferral method 
is applied. PRS2 is a controlled partnership with respect to USP. 
Under Sec.  1.721(c)-5(c)(5)(i), the PRS1 contribution is a 
successor event with respect to the USP contribution.
    (iv) Results: application of remedial allocation method. (A) 
Under Sec.  1.704-3(d)(2), in year 1, PRS2 has $24 million of book 
amortization with respect to the patent ($6 million ($30 million of 
book value equal to adjusted tax basis divided by the 5-year 
remaining recovery period) plus $18 million ($270 million excess of 
book value over tax basis divided by the new 15-year recovery 
period)). PRS2 has $6 million of tax amortization. Under the PRS2 
partnership agreement, PRS2 allocates $8 million of book 
amortization to CFC2 and $16 million of book amortization to PRS1. 
Because of the application of the ceiling rule, PRS2 allocates $6 
million of tax amortization to CFC2 and $0 of tax amortization to 
PRS1. Because the ceiling rule would cause a disparity of $2 million 
between CFC2's book and tax amortization, PRS2 must make a remedial 
allocation of $2 million of tax amortization to CFC2 and an 
offsetting remedial allocation of $2 million of taxable income to 
PRS1.
    (B) PRS1's distributive share of each of PRS2's items with 
respect to the patent is $16 million of book amortization, $0 of tax 
amortization, and $2 million of taxable income from the remedial 
allocation from PRS1. Under Sec.  1.704-3(a)(9), PRS1 must allocate 
its distributive share of each of PRS2's items with respect to the 
patent in a manner that takes into account USP's remaining built-in 
gain in the patent. Therefore, PRS1 allocates $2 million of taxable 
income to USP. Under Sec.  1.704-3(a)(13)(ii), PRS1 treats its 
distributive share of each of PRS2's items of amortization with 
respect to PRS2's patent as items of amortization with respect to 
PRS1's interest in PRS2. Under the PRS1 partnership agreement, PRS1 
allocates $8 million of book amortization and $0 of tax amortization 
to CFC1, and $8 million of book amortization and $0 of tax 
amortization to USP. Because the ceiling rule would cause a 
disparity of $8 million between CFC1's book and tax amortization, 
PRS1 must make a remedial allocation of $8 million of tax 
amortization to CFC1. PRS1 must also make an offsetting remedial 
allocation of $8 million of taxable income to USP. USP reports $10 
million of taxable income ($2 million of remedial income from PRS2 
and $8 million of remedial income from PRS1).
    (4) Example 4: Section 721(c) partnership ceases to have a 
related foreign person as a partner--(i) Facts. In year 1, USP and 
CFC1 form PRS1. USP contributes a trademark with a built-in gain of 
$5 million in exchange for a 60-percent interest, and CFC1 
contributes other property in exchange for the remaining 40-percent 
interest. With respect to all contributions described in Sec.  
1.721(c)-2(b), the de minimis exception does not apply, and the gain 
deferral method is applied. On day 1 of year 4, CFC1 sells its 
entire interest in PRS1 to FX. There is no plan for a related 
foreign person with respect to USP to subsequently become a partner 
in PRS1 (or a successor).
    (ii) Results. (A) PRS1 is a section 721(c) partnership.
    (B) With respect to year 4, under Sec.  1.721(c)-5(b)(5), the 
sale is a termination event because, as a result of CFC1's sale of 
its interest, PRS1 will no longer have a partner that is a related 
foreign person, and there is no plan for a related foreign person to 
subsequently become a partner in PRS1 (or a successor). Thus, under 
Sec.  1.721(c)-5(b)(1), the trademark is no longer subject to the 
gain deferral method.
    (5) Example 5: Transfer described in section 367 of section 
721(c) property to a foreign corporation--(i) Facts. In year 1, USP, 
CFC1, and USX form PRS1. USP contributes a patent with a built-in 
gain of $5 million in exchange for a 60-percent interest, CFC1 
contributes other property in exchange for a 30-percent interest, 
and USX contributes cash in exchange for a 10-percent interest. With 
respect to all contributions described in Sec.  1.721(c)-2(b), the 
de minimis exception does not apply, and the gain deferral method is 
applied. In year 3, when the patent has remaining built-in gain, 
PRS1 transfers the patent to FX in a transaction described in 
section 351.
    (ii) Results. (A) PRS1 is a section 721(c) partnership.
    (B) With respect to year 3, the transfer of the patent to FX is 
a transaction described in section 367(d). Therefore, under Sec.  
1.721(c)-5(e), the patent is no longer subject to the gain deferral 
method. Under Sec. Sec.  1.367(d)-1T(d)(1) and 1.367(a)-1T(c)(3)(i), 
for purposes of section 367(d), USP and USX are treated as 
transferring their proportionate share of the patent actually 
transferred by PRS1 to FX. Under Sec.  1.721(c)-5(e), to the extent 
USP and USX are treated as transferring the patent to FX, the tax 
consequences are determined under section

[[Page 3851]]

367(d) and the regulations under section 367(d). With respect to the 
remaining portion of the patent, if any, which is attributable to 
CFC1, USP must recognize an amount of gain equal to the remaining 
built-in gain that would have been allocated to USP if PRS1 had sold 
that portion of the patent immediately before the transfer for fair 
market value. Under Sec.  1.721(c)-4(c)(1), USP must increase the 
basis in its partnership interest in PRS1 by the amount of gain 
recognized by USP and under Sec.  1.721(c)-4(c)(2), immediately 
before the transfer, PRS1 must increase its basis in the patent by 
the same amount. The stock in FX received by PRS1 is not subject to 
the gain deferral method.
    (6) Example 6: Limited remedial allocation method for anti-
churning property with respect to related partners--(i) Facts. USP, 
CFC1, and FX form PRS1. On January 1 of year 1, USP contributes 
intellectual property (IP) with a book value of $600 million and an 
adjusted tax basis of $0 in exchange for a 60-percent interest. The 
IP is a section 197(f)(9) intangible (within the meaning of Sec.  
1.197-2(h)(1)(i)) that was not an amortizable section 197 intangible 
in USP's hands. CFC1 contributes cash of $300 million in exchange 
for a 30-percent interest, and FX contributes cash of $100 million 
in exchange for a 10-percent interest. The IP is section 721(c) 
property, and PRS1 is a section 721(c) partnership. The gain 
deferral method is applied. The partnership agreement provides that 
PRS1 will make allocations under section 704(c) with respect to the 
IP using the remedial allocation method under Sec.  1.704-
3(d)(5)(iii). All of PRS1's allocations with respect to the IP 
satisfy the requirements of the gain deferral method. On January 1 
of year 16, PRS1 sells the IP for cash of $900 million to a person 
that is not a related person. During years 1 through 16, PRS1 earns 
no income other than gain from the sale of the IP in year 16, has no 
expenses or deductions other than from amortization of the IP, and 
makes no distributions.
    (ii) Results: Year 1. Under Sec.  1.704-3(d)(5)(iii)(B), PRS1 
must recover the excess of the book value of the IP over its 
adjusted tax basis at the time of the contribution ($600 million) 
using any recovery period and amortization method that would have 
been available to PRS1 if the property had been newly purchased 
property from an unrelated party. Thus, under section 197(a), PRS1 
must amortize $600 million of the IP's book value ratably over 15 
years for book purposes, and PRS1 will have $40 million of book 
amortization per year without any tax amortization. Under the 
partnership agreement, in year 1, PRS1 allocates book amortization 
of $24 million to USP, $12 million to CFC1, and $4 million to FX. 
Because in year 1 the ceiling rule would cause a disparity between 
FX's allocations of book and tax amortization, PRS1 makes a remedial 
allocation of tax amortization of $4 million to FX and an offsetting 
remedial allocation of $4 million of taxable income to USP. In year 
1, the ceiling rule would also cause a disparity between CFC1's 
allocations of book and tax amortization. However, Sec.  1.197-
2(h)(12)(vii)(B) precludes PRS1 from making a remedial allocation of 
tax amortization to CFC1. Instead, pursuant to Sec.  1.704-
3(d)(5)(iii)(C), PRS1 increases the adjusted tax basis in the IP by 
$12 million, and pursuant to Sec.  1.704-3(d)(5)(iii)(D), that basis 
adjustment is solely with respect to CFC1. Pursuant to Sec.  1.704-
3(d)(5)(iii)(C), PRS1 also makes an offsetting remedial allocation 
of $12 million of taxable income to USP.
    (iii) Results: Years 2-15. At the end of year 15, PRS1 has book 
basis and adjusted tax basis of $0 in the IP. PRS1 has amortized 
$600 million for book purposes by allocating total book amortization 
deductions of $360 million to USP, $180 million to CFC1, and $60 
million to FX. For U.S. tax purposes, by the end of year 15, PRS1 
has made remedial allocations of $60 million of tax amortization to 
FX and increased the adjusted tax basis in the IP by $180 million 
solely with respect to CFC1. PRS1 has also made total remedial 
allocations of $240 million of taxable income to USP (attributable 
to $60 million of remedial tax amortization to FX and $180 million 
of tax basis adjustments with respect to CFC1). With respect to 
their partnership interests in PRS1, USP has a capital account and 
an adjusted tax basis of $240 million, CFC1 has a capital account of 
$120 million and an adjusted tax basis of $300 million, and FX has a 
capital account and an adjusted tax basis of $40 million.
    (iv) Results: Sale of property in year 16. PRS1's sale of the IP 
for cash of $900 million on January 1 of year 16 results in $900 
million of book and tax gain ($900 million-$0). PRS1 allocates the 
book and tax gain 60 percent to USP ($540 million), 10 percent to FX 
($90 million), and 30 percent to CFC1 ($270 million). However, under 
Sec.  1.704-3(d)(5)(iii)(D)(3), CFC1's tax gain is $90 million, 
equal to its share of PRS1's gain ($270 million), minus the amount 
of the tax basis adjustment ($180 million). After the sale, PRS1's 
only property is cash of $1.3 billion. With respect to their 
partnership interests in PRS1, USP has a capital account and an 
adjusted tax basis of $780 million, CFC1 has a capital account and 
an adjusted tax basis of $390 million, and FX has a capital account 
and an adjusted tax basis of $130 million.

    (a) * * *
    (1) * * *
    (iii) The United States person is a U.S. transferor (as defined in 
Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(18)) that makes a gain deferral contribution and is 
required to report under Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)(2). The reporting required

section 7701(a)(4).
* * * * *
    (3) Indirect transfer through a foreign partnership. Solely for 
purposes of this section, if a foreign partnership transfers section 
721(c) property (as defined in Sec.  1.721(c)-1(b)(15)) to another 
foreign partnership in a transfer described in Sec.  1.721(c)-3(d) 
(tiered-partnership rules), then the transferor foreign partnership's 
partners will be considered to have transferred a proportionate share 
of the property to the foreign partnership.
* * * * *
    (c) * * *
    (8) With respect to reporting required under Sec.  1.721(c)-6(b)(2) 
and paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section with regard to a gain 
deferral contribution, the information required by Sec.  1.721(c)-
6(b)(2); and

    (h) * * *
    (3) Reasonable cause exception. Under section 6038B(c)(2) and this 
section, the provisions of paragraph (h)(1) of this section will not 
apply if the United States person shows, in a timely manner, that a 
failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect. 
A United States person's statement that the failure to comply was due 
to reasonable cause and not willful neglect will be considered timely 
only if, promptly after the United States person becomes aware of the 
failure, an amended return is filed for the taxable year to which the 
failure relates that includes the information that should have been 
included with the original return for such taxable year or that 
otherwise complies with the rules of this section, and that includes a 
written statement explaining the reasons for the failure to comply. If 
any taxable year of the United States person is under examination when 
the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended return must be 
delivered to the Internal Revenue Service personnel conducting the 
examination when the amended return is filed. If no taxable year of the 
United States person is under

[[Page 3852]]

examination when the amended return is filed, a copy of the amended 
return must be delivered to the Director of Field Operations, Cross 
Border Activities Practice Area of Large Business & International (or 
any successor to the roles and responsibilities of such position, as 
appropriate) (Director). Whether a failure to comply was due to 
reasonable cause and not willful neglect will be determined by the 
Director under all the facts and circumstances.
