-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document makes technical corrections to certain 
amendments to the Commission's disclosure rules and forms adopted in 
Release No. 33-10762 (March 2, 2020), which was published in the 
Federal Register on April 20, 2020. Specifically, this document 
conforms the numbering of certain regulatory text to match renumbering 
set out in a rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 
Register.

DATES: Effective January 4, 2021.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Todd E. Hardiman, Associate Chief

Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are making technical corrections to
