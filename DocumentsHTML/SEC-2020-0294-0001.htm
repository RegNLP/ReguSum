SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Part 200

[Release Nos. 33-10757; 34-88245; IA-5446; IC-33802]


Delegation of Authority to the General Counsel of the Commission

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is 
revising regulations with respect to the delegations of authority to 
the Commission's General Counsel. The revisions are a result of the 
Commission's experience with its bankruptcy program and they are 
intended to conserve Commission resources by delegating to staff the 
discretion to file objections in bankruptcy cases with respect to the 
frequently recurring issue of non-debtor third-party releases. The 
revisions will expedite and enhance the effectiveness of the 
Commission's bankruptcy program by enabling staff to meet bankruptcy 
court deadlines that affect issues important to the Commission.

DATES: Effective March 2, 2020.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Morgan Bradylyons, Bankruptcy Counsel, 
and Tracey Hardin, Assistant General Counsel for Appellate Litigation 
and Bankruptcy, Office of the General Counsel, (202) 551-7926, 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549-9040.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

I. Background

    The Commission is revising the delegations of authority to its 
General Counsel as a result of the Commission's experience with its 
bankruptcy program. The revisions are intended to increase the 
efficiency of the Commission's operations by delegating to staff the 
discretion to file objections in bankruptcy cases with respect to the 
frequently recurring issue of non-debtor third-party releases. The 
revisions will expedite and enhance the effectiveness of the 
Commission's bankruptcy program by enabling staff to meet bankruptcy 
court deadlines that affect issues important to the Commission. 
Congress has authorized such delegation by Public Law 87-592, 76 Stat. 
394, 15 U.S.C. 78d-1(a), which provides that the Commission ``shall 
have the authority to delegate, by published order or rule, any of its 
functions to . . . an employee or employee board, including functions 
with respect to hearing, determining, ordering, certifying, reporting, 
or otherwise acting as to any work, business or matter.''
    Accordingly, the Commission is amending its rules to delegate 
authority to the General Counsel to file objections in bankruptcy cases 
with respect to the routine, recurring issue of non-debtor third-party 
release provisions. Under this delegation, the General Counsel (or, 
under his or her direction, such persons as might be designated from 
time to time by the Chairman of the Commission) would authorize the 
staff, in bankruptcy cases, to take the following actions with respect 
to plan or settlement provisions that have the effect of releasing, 
exculpating, discharging, or permanently enjoining actions against non-
debtor third parties in contravention of Section 524(e) of the 
Bankruptcy Code or applicable law: (1) Object to approval of disclosure 
statements, including on the basis that the disclosure statement lacks 
adequate information under Section 1125(b) to support such release 
provisions; (2) object to confirmation of bankruptcy plans; or (3) 
object to approval of settlements.
    Notwithstanding this delegation, the General Counsel may submit any 
matter he or she believes appropriate to the Commission. Furthermore, 
any action taken by the General Counsel pursuant to delegated authority 
would be subject to Commission review as provided by Rules 430 and 431 
of the Commission's Rules of Practice, 17 CFR 201.430-201.431 and 15 
U.S.C. 78d-1(b).

II. Administrative Law Matters

    The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (``APA''), that these revisions relate solely to agency 
organization, procedure, or practice and do not constitute a 
substantive rule. 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A). Accordingly, the APA's 
provisions regarding notice of rulemaking, opportunity for public 
comment, and advance publication of the amendments prior to their 
effective date are not applicable. These changes are therefore 
effective on March 2, 2020. For the same reason, and because these 
amendments do not affect the rights or obligations of non-agency 
parties, the provisions of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act are not applicable. 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C) (the term ``rule'' 
does not include ``any rule of agency organization, procedure, or 
practice that does not substantially affect the rights or obligations 
of non-agency parties.'') Additionally, the provisions of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., which apply

[[Page 12222]]

only when notice and comment are required by the APA or other law, are 
not applicable. These amendments do not contain any collection of 
information requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 
1995. See 5 CFR 1320.3. Further, because the amendments impose no new 
burdens on private parties, the Commission does not believe that the 
amendments will have any impact on competition for purposes of Section 
23(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

III. Statutory Authority

    This rule is adopted pursuant to statutory authority granted to the 
Commission, including Section 19 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 
U.S.C. 77s; Sections 4A, 4B, and 23 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78d-
1, 78d-2, and 78w; Section 38 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 
U.S.C. 80a-37; Section 211 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 
U.S.C. 80b-11; and Section 3 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 
U.S.C. 7202.
