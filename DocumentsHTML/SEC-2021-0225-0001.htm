I. Discussion

    The Commission is amending its rules delegating authority to the 
Commission's staff. Currently, the Commission delegates to its staff 
certain authorities that would otherwise be exercised only by the 
Commission itself. These delegations are codified in our Rules of 
General Organization,\1\ alongside descriptions of the responsibilities 
of the divisions and offices.\2\ We are amending these rules to better 
reflect the way the Commission conducts its business and to use our 
resources more efficiently. In some cases, authority previously granted 
to a particular member of the staff is no longer appropriate, because, 
for example, the authority references a rule or process that has since 
been amended or rescinded or because the responsibility for the 
delegated activity should now rest with another member of the staff. In 
other instances, authority that is currently exercised only by the 
Commission could be exercised by the staff with appropriate Commission 
oversight, thereby preserving the Commission's resources for other 
activities. In addition, certain of the descriptions are no longer an 
accurate reflection of the responsibilities of the respective divisions 
and offices. We have determined, therefore, to make a number of 
amendments to our rules delegating authority to the staff and to the 
division and office descriptions, as discussed in detail below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Articles 30-1 through 30-19 [17 CFR 200.30-1 through 200.30-
19].
    \2\ Articles 10 through 27 [17 CFR 200.10 through 200.27].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Delegation to the Director and Chief Economist of the Division of 
Economic and Risk Analysis

    We are delegating authority to the Director of the Division of 
Economic and Risk Analysis (``DERA'') and Chief Economist to update 
taxonomies and schemas required for use in Commission filings and made 
available on the Commission's website.\3\ DERA maintains on the 
Commission's website a collection of taxonomies and schemas related to 
certain Commission structured data reporting requirements.\4\ A 
taxonomy is a list of standardized disclosure elements that covers a 
variety of concepts, and can contain descriptive labels, definitions, 
and authoritative references to standards and Commission 
regulations.\5\ Meanwhile, a schema defines the elements and attributes 
of a structured data report so that the report is appropriately 
constrained for machine-readability.\6\ Updates to these taxonomies and 
schemas are ministerial in nature. The updates generally reflect 
changes to the underlying standard--such as to U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles--to the underlying technology, to industry 
practice, or to Commission requirements. We believe that delegating 
authority for updates to taxonomies and schemas to the Director of DERA 
and Chief Economist will

[[Page 9437]]

conserve our resources and increase efficiency, as these updates are 
ministerial in nature and in the normal course of business. In 
addition, we are updating the description of the responsibilities of 
the Director of DERA and Chief Economist in our rules to include that 
person's current title and responsibilities.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Article 30-2.
    \4\ Taxonomies; <a href="http://www.sec.gov/structureddata/data_taxonomies">www.sec.gov/structureddata/data_taxonomies</a>.
    \5\ By referencing the same underlying taxonomy, structured data 
from different filers and over different reporting periods can be 
instantly aggregated and compared for analysis. Currently, DERA's 
website hosts the U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles 
(``GAAP'') eXtensible Business Reporting Language (``XBRL'') 
Taxonomy, the International Financial Reporting Standards (``IFRS'') 
Taxonomy, the U.S. Mutual Fund Risk/Return XBRL Taxonomy, the SEC 
Reporting Taxonomies (``SRT''), the Record of Credit Ratings XBRL 
Taxonomy, the Draft Closed-End Fund Taxonomy, and the Draft Variable 
Insurance Product Taxonomy.
    \6\ Currently, DERA's website hosts the Order Handling Data 
Schema for Broker-Dealers, the Exchange Transaction Fee Summary 
Schema for National Market System Stocks, the Draft Volcker Rule 
Metrics Instructions and Technical Specifications, and the Draft 
Financial Products Markup Language (``FpML'') and FIXML Schemas for 
Security-Based Swap Data Repositories.
    \7\ Article 23a.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Delegation to the Director of the Division of Trading and Markets

    We are amending our rules delegating authority to the Director of 
the Division of Trading and Markets (``TM''), in some instances 
delegating new authority and, in others, eliminating current authority.
1. Delegation of Advance Notice Authority
    We are delegating authority to the Director of TM for the 
publication of an advance notice (``Advance Notice'') filed by a 
registered clearing agency designated as systemically important (a 
``DCA'') by the Financial Stability Oversight Council; \8\ for the 
issuance of a request that the DCA provide any information necessary to 
assess the effect a proposed change would have on the nature or level 
of risks associated with such DCA's payment, clearing, or settlement 
activities and the sufficiency of any proposed risk management 
techniques; \9\ for the extension of the period of review when the 
proposed changes in an Advance Notice raise novel or complex issues and 
publication of notice thereof; \10\ and for the publication of a 
withdrawal of an Advance Notice.\11\ The current process associated 
with Advance Notice processing requires Commission action to, among 
other things, publish notice of an Advance Notice and any amendments 
thereto; make an additional information request; extend the period of 
review of the Advance Notice when the proposed changes in an Advance 
Notice raise novel or complex issues; or publish notice of a withdrawal 
of an Advance Notice. These actions do not raise significant issues for 
Commission consideration and are more administrative in nature in that 
they provide notice to the public on the status of an Advance Notice 
proposal and seek public comment for information to assist the 
Commission as it considers each such action individually.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Article 30-3(a)(91).
    \9\ Article 30-3(a)(93).
    \10\ Article 30-3(a)(94).
    \11\ Article 30-3(a)(92).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We believe that delegating authority for Advance Notices will 
conserve our resources and increase efficiency, as the processing 
functions for Advance Notices are, in each instance, procedural matters 
that are ministerial in nature and in the normal course of business. In 
addition, this delegation will harmonize the staff's authority over 
issuance of Advance Notices and related self-regulatory organization 
(``SRO'') rule change filings. Finally, the expedited process that 
would result from a delegation of authority to affect these matters 
would provide TM and the Commission additional time to analyze and 
consider a final determination on an Advance Notice proposal after the 
comment period has closed.
2. Delegation of Security-Based Swap Authority to the Director of TM 
and the Director of the Division of Examinations
    We are delegating authority to the Director of TM and the Director 
of the Division of Examinations (``Examinations'') \12\ in connection 
with applications for registration as a security-based swap dealer or 
major security-based swap participant (``SBS Entities'').\13\ We 
believe that permitting the Director of TM and the Director of 
Examinations to share this authority will more efficiently allocate 
agency resources. First, we are delegating authority to authorize 
issuance of orders granting ongoing registration to SBS Entities 
pursuant to 17 CFR 240.15Fb2-1(d) \14\ under the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'').\15\ Once an applicant is 
conditionally registered as an SBS entity, the Commission may grant or 
deny ongoing registration. The Commission will grant ongoing 
registration if it finds that the requirements of section 15F(b) of the 
Exchange Act are satisfied.\16\ We believe that delegating the 
authority to the Director of TM and the Director of Examinations to 
make the necessary findings and grant ongoing registration will make 
efficient use of our resources, while still reserving for Commission 
consideration any recommendation to deny ongoing registration. Similar 
delegated authority exists for the Director of TM to grant registration 
as a broker or dealer.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ Examinations was previously known as the Office of 
Compliance Inspections and Examinations, or ``OCIE.'' See Public 
Statement on the Renaming of the Office of Compliance Inspections 
and Examinations to the Division of Examinations (Dec. 17, 2020), 
available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-division-examinations">https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-division-examinations</a>.
    \13\ See infra footnotes 14-20 and accompanying text.
    \14\ Rule 15Fb2-1(d).
    \15\ 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.; Article 30-3(a)(86); Article 30-
18(m)(1)(i).
    \16\ 17 CFR 240.15Fb2-1(e).
    \17\ Article 30-3(a)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, we are delegating authority to the Director of TM and the 
Director of Examinations to authorize the issuance of orders cancelling 
registrations of SBS Entities, or pending applications for 
registration, if such SBS Entities or applicants for registration are 
no longer in existence or have ceased to do business as an SBS 
Entity.\18\ We believe that delegated authority to cancel the 
registrations of, or applications for registration by, non-operational 
SBS Entities will make efficient use of our resources, while still 
reserving for Commission consideration any recommendation to revoke the 
registration of an operating SBS Entity. Similar delegated authority 
exists for staff to cancel registrations of non-operational brokers and 
dealers.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ Article 30-3(a)(87); Article 30-18(m)(1)(ii).
    \19\ Article 30-3(a)(3)(ii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Third, we are delegating to the Director of TM and the Director of 
Examinations authority to determine whether notices of withdrawal from 
registration by SBS Entities shall become effective sooner or later 
than the default 60-day waiting period.\20\ We believe that delegated 
authority to change the waiting period for withdrawal of registration 
as an SBS Entity will make efficient use of our resources by allowing 
staff to determine, and communicate to registrants, the date on which a 
withdrawal of registration will become effective.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ Article 30-3(a)(88); Articles 30-18(m)(1)(iii).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Delegation of SBS Entity Application Authority
    We are also delegating authority to the Director of TM to grant 
certain applications made by SBS Entities. Section 201.194 of our Rules 
of Practice provides for applications by SBS Entities for statutorily 
disqualified associated persons to effect or be involved in effecting 
security-based swaps.\21\ We are delegating authority to the Director 
of TM to grant such applications.\22\ We believe that delegated 
authority to grant these applications will make efficient use of the 
Commission's resources, while still preserving the Commission's ability 
to deny applications. We have already delegated authority to the 
Director of TM to grant certain similar applications with respect to an 
SRO.\23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \21\ Rule 194 (17 CFR 201.194).
    \22\ Article 30-3(a)(90).
    \23\ Article 30-3(a)(4)(i) (delegating authority to the Director 
of TM to grant applications with respect to membership in, 
association with a member of, or participation in, a self-regulatory 
organization and for other relief as to persons who are subject to 
an applicable disqualification where such relationships or other 
relief have been approved or recommended by a self-regulatory 
organization); see also 17 CFR 200.30-4(a)(5) [Article 30-4(a)(5)] 
(delegating authority to the Director of the Division of Enforcement 
to grant or deny applications made pursuant to 17 CFR 201.193 [Rule 
193 of the Commission's Rules of Practice] by barred individuals for 
consent to associate with other types of registrants); Article 30-
1(10) (delegating authority to the Director of CF to grant or deny 
applications for relief from being considered an ``ineligible 
issuer'' under 17 CFR 230.403 [Securities Act Rule 405]).

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 9438]]

4. Delegation of Substituted Compliance Authority
    We are delegating authority to the Director of TM to authorize the 
publication in the Federal Register of notices that a complete 
application for substituted compliance has been submitted to the 
Commission, under 17 CFR 240.0-13.\24\ Rule 0-13 provides the 
procedures for filing applications to request a substituted compliance 
or listed jurisdiction order under the Exchange Act.\25\ We believe 
that delegating the authority to make the necessary findings will make 
efficient use of our resources. The action is administrative in nature 
and provides notice to the public of the completion of an application, 
beginning the process of seeking public comment for information to 
assist the Commission as it considers substituted compliance with 
respect to an application.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \24\ Rule 0-13 under the Exchange Act; Article 30-3(a)(89).
    \25\ 17 CFR 240.0-13.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Eliminated Delegations of Authority
    We are eliminating certain current delegations of authority. First, 
we are eliminating the following delegations of authority because they 
refer to rules or processes that have themselves been eliminated:
    <bullet> Authority to grant requests for exemptions from former 17 
CFR 240.10a-1(f) (rule 10a-1(f) under the Exchange Act), which we have 
previously rescinded.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ Current Article 30-3(a)(15).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to publish notice of the filing of a designation 
plan with respect to national market system securities, or any proposed 
amendment thereto, and to approve such plan or amendment under former 
17 CFR 242.600 (rule 600),\27\ which rule has already been amended to 
eliminate the relevant process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ Current Article 30-3(a)(37).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to review and, where appropriate, approve the 
selection by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB'') of 
public representatives to serve on the MSRB under former section 
15B(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act,\28\ which has previously been amended 
to eliminate the relevant process.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \28\ Current Article 30-3(a)(40).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to grant exemptions from former 17 CFR 240.3b-9 
(rule 3b-9 under the Exchange Act),\29\ because the rule was rescinded 
by the Commission after being invalidated by the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ Current Article 30-3(a)(45).
    \30\ See Exchange Act Release No. 56502 (Sept. 24, 2007) [72 FR 
56562 (Oct. 3, 2007)]; see also American Bankers Association v. SEC, 
804 F.2d 739 (D.C. Cir. 1986).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to grant exemptions from 17 CFR 240.17a-23 (Rule 
17a-23 under the Exchange Act),\31\ which has been rescinded.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ Current Article 30-3(a)(60).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to issue notices related to a transaction fee 
pilot program that has been vacated.\32\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \32\ Current Article 30-3(a)(84).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, we are eliminating the following delegations of authority 
to the Director of TM because the contemplated activities are 
appropriately within the purview of other divisions and offices:
    <bullet> Authority to grant or deny exemptions, either 
unconditionally or on specified terms and conditions, from 17 CFR 
240.15c2-12 (Rule 15c2-12 under the Exchange Act),\33\ which is similar 
to authority we are delegating to the Director of the Office of 
Municipal Securities (``OMS'').\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ Current Article 30-3(a)(48).
    \34\ See infra Part II.C.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to grant requests for exemptions from the tender 
offer provisions of 17 CFR 240.14e-1 (Rule 14e-1 of Regulation 14E 
under the Exchange Act),\35\ which rule is administered by the Division 
of Corporation Finance (``CF'').\36\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ Current Article 30-3(a)(67).
    \36\ Article 30-1(f)(16)(ii) [17 CFR 200.30-1(f)(16)(ii)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to designate officers empowered to administer 
oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, 
take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, 
correspondence, memoranda, contracts, agreements, or other records in 
the course of investigations instituted by the Commission under section 
21(d) of the Exchange Act,\37\ which is similar to authority currently 
exercised by the Division of Enforcement.\38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ Current Article 30-3(b).
    \38\ Article 30-4(a)(1) [17 CFR 200.30-4(a)(2)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority, in certain nonpublic investigatory proceedings, 
to grant requests of persons to procure copies of the transcript of 
their testimony,\39\ which is similar to authority currently exercised 
by the Division of Enforcement.\40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ Current Article 30-3(c).
    \40\ Article 30-4(a)(2) [17 CFR 200.30-4(a)(2)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, we are eliminating current authority to extend trading 
privileges and to deny applications for unlisted trading privileges 
(``UTP'') by national securities exchanges under 17 CFR 240.12f-1 (Rule 
12f-1 under the Exchange Act), provided that any applicant exchange 
denied unlisted traded privileges is advised of its right to have such 
denial reviewed by the Commission.\41\ The UTP Act of 1994 changed the 
way UTP was extended by no longer requiring applications for UTP to be 
filed with and approved by the Commission. Prior to the enactment of 
the UTP Act, the Commission received hundreds of applications to extend 
UTP each year. Although section 12(f)(2) of the Act and Rule 12f-1 are 
not part of that UTP extension process and instead allow for the 
suspension and reinstatement of trading for securities that are already 
trading UTP, the Division has rarely used its delegated authority under 
these provisions so the delegation is being eliminated.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ Current Article 30-3(a)(2).
    \42\ Article 30-3(a)(2) (removed and reserved). We are also 
making a technical correction to update the name of TM in a 
delegation. Article 30-3(l). In addition, we are correcting a 
scrivener's error in a delegation to the Director of TM. Article 30-
3(a)(47). We are also making a technical correction to a delegation 
to the Director of TM. Article 30-3(a)(49).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Delegation to the Director of the Office of Municipal Securities

    We are delegating additional authority to the Director of OMS to 
carry out functions--with respect to the Municipal Securities 
Rulemaking Board (``MSRB''), municipal securities, and municipal 
securities dealers--that are currently delegated to the Director of TM. 
These authorities include:
    <bullet> Authority to publish notices of proposed rule changes 
filed by the MSRB, to approve such proposed rule changes, to find good 
cause to approve a proposed rule change earlier than 30 days after 
publication of such proposed rule change, to disapprove a proposed rule 
change subject to certain requirements, and related authorities; \43\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ Article 30-3a(a)(2). This authority is similar to authority 
already delegated to the Director of TM. See Article 30-3(a)(12).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to extend for a period not exceeding 90 days 
from the date of publication of notice of the filing of a proposed rule 
change by the MSRB the period during which the Commission must by order 
approve or disapprove

[[Page 9439]]

the proposed rule change or institute proceedings to determine whether 
the proposed rule change should be disapproved, and related 
authorities; \44\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ Article 30-3a(a)(7). This authority is similar to authority 
already delegated to the Director of TM. See Article 30-3(a)(31).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to institute proceedings to determine whether a 
proposed rule change of the MSRB should be disapproved, to provide to 
the MSRB notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration, and 
to extend for a period not exceeding 240 days from the date of 
publication of notice of the filing of the proposed rule during which 
the Commission must issue an order approving or disapproving the 
proposed rule, and related authorities; \45\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ Article 30-3a(a)(11). This authority is similar to 
authority already delegated to the Director of TM. See Article 30-
3(a)(57).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to temporarily suspend a change in the rules of 
the MSRB; \46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ Article 30-3a(a)(12). This authority is similar to 
authority already delegated to the Director of TM. See Article 30-
3(a)(58).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to reduce the period before which a proposed 
rule change can become operative, and to reduce the period between an 
MSRB submission of a filing and a pre-filing notification; \47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \47\ Article 30-3a(a)(13). This authority is similar to 
authority already delegated to the Director of TM. See Article 30-
3(a)(59).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to review and grant or deny exemptions from the 
rule filing requirements of section 19(b) of the Exchange Act,\48\ in a 
case where the MSRB elects to incorporate by reference one or more 
rules of another self-regulatory organization, subject to certain terms 
and conditions; \49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b).
    \49\ Article 30-3a(a)(14). This authority is similar to 
authority already delegated to the Director of TM. See Article 30-
3(a)(76).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to issue orders granting registration of 
municipal securities dealers within 45 days of the filing of an 
application for registration; \50\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \50\ Article 30-3a(a)(3). This authority is similar to authority 
already delegated to the Director of TM. See Article 30-3(a)(13).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Authority to grant, deny, and revoke applications for

about any examination of such a registered municipal securities dealer 
by the Commission; \53\

    We believe it is appropriate for the Director of OMS--like the 
Director of TM--to exercise such functions and that delegating this 
authority will conserve our resources and improve efficiency. In 
addition, we are updating the description of the responsibilities of 
the Director of OMS in our rules to include that person's current 
responsibilities.\61\

    \61\ Article 19d.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Delegation to the Director of the Division of Investment Management

    The Commission is eliminating a current delegation to the Director 
of the Division of Investment Management (``IM''). The Commission 
previously delegated to the Director of IM the same authority with 
respect to certain rules under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities 
Act'') \62\ that it also delegated to each Regional Director.\63\ This 
delegation to the Director of IM refers to the delegation to each 
Regional Director that has since been eliminated by the Commission.\64\ 
We are therefore eliminating the delegation to the Director of IM that 
refers to the previously eliminated delegation to each Regional 
Director.\65\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.
    \63\ Current article 30-5(h)(1).
    \64\ Id. (providing that Director of the Division of Investment 
Management shall have the same authority with respect to the 
Securities Act of 1933 and 17 CFR 230.251 through 230.262 (rules 251 
through 263 thereunder) as that delegated to each Regional Director 
in Article 30-6(b) and (c)).
    \65\ See article 30-5(h)(1) (removed and reserved).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Delegation to the Chief Accountant

    The Commission is delegating authority to its Chief Accountant to 
share with certain specified persons nonpublic information and files 
with the concurrence of the head of the division or office responsible 
for such information and files.\66\ Rule 24c-1 under the Exchange Act 
provides that the Commission may, in its discretion and upon a showing 
that such information is needed, provide nonpublic information in its 
possession to certain persons if they provide such assurances of 
confidentiality as the Commission deems appropriate.\67\ The Commission 
has previously delegated similar authority to several other divisions 
and offices.\68\ The Chief Accountant's responsibilities related to the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the ``PCAOB'') occasionally 
requires the sharing of nonpublic information. We believe that 
providing the Chief Accountant with the same authority delegated to 
other divisions and offices will make

[[Page 9440]]

coordination with the PCAOB more efficient.

similar authority to the General Counsel of the Commission); article 
30-18(a) (delegating similar authority to the Director of the Office 
of Compliance Inspections and Examinations).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

F. Delegation to the General Counsel

    The Commission is clarifying a delegation of authority to the 
General Counsel. We have previously delegated to the General Counsel 
authority to approve non-expert, non-privileged, factual testimony by 
present or former staff members, and the production of non-privileged 
documents, when validly subpoenaed, and to assert governmental 
privileges on behalf of the Commission in litigation where the 
Commission appears as a party or in response to third party 
subpoenas.\69\ Our rules specify, however, that those functions are not 
delegated to the General Counsel with respect to proceedings in which 
the Chairman or the General Counsel determines that separation of 
functions requirements or other circumstances would make inappropriate 
the General Counsel's exercise of such delegated functions.\70\ Rather, 
with respect to such proceedings, such functions had been delegated to 
the Executive Assistant to the Chairman.\71\ The Executive Assistant to 
the Chairman is a position that is no longer in use. We are therefore 
removing and reserving the provisions relating to description of and 
delegation to the Executive Assistant to the Chairman.\72\ We have 
determined, instead, to delegate such functions in those circumstances 
to the Secretary of the Commission.\73\ This delegation is similar to a 
prior delegation that we made to the Secretary for functions otherwise 
carried out by the General Counsel when the Chairman or General Counsel 
determines that separation of functions requirements or other 
circumstances would make exercise of the delegated functions by the 
General Counsel inappropriate.\74\

typographical error in the rules delegating authority to the General 
Counsel. Article 30-14(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

G. Delegation to the Director of the Division of Examinations

    The Commission is eliminating certain current delegations of 
authority to the Director of Examinations that Examinations does not 
use. The Commission has previously delegated to the Director of 
Examinations authority to grant, deny, and revoke applications for 
confidential treatment filed pursuant to section 24(b) of the Exchange 
Act and rule 24b-2 thereunder; \75\ to administer the provisions of 
section 24(d) of the Exchange Act; \76\ to notify the Securities 
Investor Protection Corporation (``SIPC'') of facts concerning the 
activities and the operational and financial condition of any 
registered broker or dealer which is or appears to be a member of SIPC 
and which is in or approaching financial difficulty within the meaning 
of section 5 of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, as 
amended; \77\ to delay certain inspections of certain newly registered 
broker-dealers under section 15(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act; \78\ and, 
in certain circumstances, to grant or deny exemptions from 17 CFR 
240.17a-25 (rule 17a-25 under the Exchange Act), among other 
authorities.\79\ The Commission is also eliminating a duplicative 
delegation that authorizes the issuance of orders canceling 
registrations or pending applications of registration of certain 
investment advisers.\80\ We understand that the Director of 
Examinations does not exercise the above authorities, and we have 
determined that it is appropriate to eliminate them. In addition, we 
are updating the name and description of the responsibilities of the 
Director of Examinations in our rules to include the current name and 
the responsibilities related to security-based swaps.\81\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \75\ Current Article 30-18(b).
    \76\ Current Article 30-18(e) (providing for administration of 
provisions related to certain records obtained from foreign 
securities authorities).
    \77\ 15 U.S.C. 78aa et seq.; current Article 30-18(f). 
Currently, rather than exercising this authority directly, it is 
Examinations's practice to notify the Division of Trading and 
Markets, which will then determine whether to exercise its 
Director's authority to notify SIPC. See Article 30-3(d) (delegating 
similar authority to the Director of Trading and Markets).
    \78\ Current Article 30-18(g).
    \79\ Current Article 30-18(h).
    \80\ Current Article 30-18(k)(2). We believe that this authority 
is duplicative of authority separately delegated to the Director of 
Examinations to authorize the issuance of orders cancelling 
registration or applications for registration of certain investment 
advisers. Article 30-18(i)(1). As discussed above, we are also 
delegating authority to the Director of Examinations that is similar 
to the authority delegated to the Director of TM concerning 
security-based swaps. Article 30-18(m); see also supra footnotes 14-
20 and accompanying text.
    \81\ Article 19c.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

H. Delegation to the Director of the Office of Credit Ratings

    The Commission is delegating authority to the Director of the 
Office of Credit Ratings (``OCR'') for functions that are currently 
delegated to the Director of TM and others. First, we are delegating 
authority to grant and deny applications for confidential treatment 
filed under section 24(b) of the Exchange Act,\82\ and to revoke a 
grant of confidential treatment for any such application.\83\ The 
authority to grant and deny applications for confidential treatment and 
revoke a grant of confidential treatment is delegated to several 
members of our staff.\84\ Second, we are delegating authority to 
administer the provisions of rule 24c-1 under the Exchange Act,\85\ 
which the Commission has previously delegated to other members of the 
staff.\86\ Finally, we are delegating authority to administer the 
provisions of section 24(d) of the Exchange Act,\87\ which the 
Commission has similarly delegated to other members of the staff.\88\ 
We believe it is appropriate for the Director of OCR to exercise such 
functions and that delegating this authority will conserve our 
resources and improve efficiency. In addition, we are adding a 
description of the responsibilities of the Director of OCR in our 
rules.\89\

I. Additional Amendments to Division and Office Descriptions and 
Delegations

    We are also amending the description for certain other divisions 
and offices to better reflect the current name or duties of those 
divisions and offices.\90\ In addition, we are amending a number of our 
division and office descriptions and delegations to remove gender-
specific language from them.\91\

Article 30-15; Article 30-18. In addition, we are correcting certain 
outdated statutory references. Article 30-1; Article 30-2; Article 
30-3; Article 30-5; Article 30-6; Article 30-7; Article 30-10.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 9441]]

II. Administrative Law Matters

    The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (``APA''), that these amendments relate solely to agency 
organization, procedure, or practice.\92\ Accordingly, the APA's 
provisions regarding notice of rulemaking and opportunity for public 
comment are not applicable. These changes are therefore effective on 
February 16, 2021. In accord with the APA, we find that there is good 
cause to establish an effective date less than 30 days after 
publication of these rules.\93\ These rules do not substantially affect 
the rights or obligations of non-agency parties and pertain to 
increasing efficiency of internal Commission operations. For the same 
reasons, the provisions of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement 
Fairness Act are not applicable.\94\ Additionally, the provisions of 
the Regulatory Flexibility Act,\95\ which apply only when notice and 
comment are required by the APA or other law, are not applicable.\96\ 
These amendments do not contain any collection of information 
requirements as defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.\97\ 
Further, because these amendments impose no new burdens on private 
parties, the Commission does not believe that the amendments will have 
any impact on competition for purposes of section 23(a)(2) of the 
Exchange Act.\98\

Commission, including section 19 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 
U.S.C. 77s; sections 4A, 4B, and 23 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78d-
