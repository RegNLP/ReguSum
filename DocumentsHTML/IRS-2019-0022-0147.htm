    (D) Safe harbor for working capital and property on which working 
capital is being expended--(1) Working capital for start-up businesses. 
For start-up businesses utilizing the working capital safe harbor, if 
paragraph (d)(3)(v) of this section treats property of an entity that 
would otherwise be nonqualified financial property as being a 
reasonable amount of working capital because of compliance with the 
three requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this 
section, the entity satisfies the requirements of section 1400Z-
2(d)(3)(A)(i) only during the working capital safe harbor period(s) for 
which the requirements of paragraphs (d)(3)(v)(A) through (C) of this 
section are satisfied; however such property is not qualified 
opportunity zone business property for any purpose.
    (2) Tangible property acquired with covered working capital. For 
any eligible entity, if tangible property referred to in paragraph 
(d)(3)(v)(A) is expected to satisfy the requirements of section 1400Z-
2(d)(2)(D)(i) as a result of the planned expenditure of working capital 
described in paragraph (d)(3)(v)(A), and is purchased, leased, or 
improved by the trade or business, pursuant to the written plan for the 
expenditure of the working capital, then the tangible property is 
treated as qualified opportunity zone business property satisfying the 
requirements of section 1400Z-2(d)(2)(D)(i), during that and subsequent 
working capital periods the property is subject to, for purposes of the 
70-percent tangible property standard in section 1400Z-2(d)(3).
