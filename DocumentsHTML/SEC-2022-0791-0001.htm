Updating EDGAR Filing Requirements and Form 144 Filings

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Introduction

    Registrants and individuals submit most documents required to be 
filed or otherwise submitted to the Commission under the Federal 
securities laws in electronic format using the Commission's EDGAR 
system. EDGAR filings are available to the public on our website.\3\ 
During the 2021 calendar year, electronic filers submitted 
approximately 916,000 filings on EDGAR. These electronic filings enable 
investors and other EDGAR users to access more quickly the information 
contained in registration statements, periodic reports, and other 
filings made with the Commission. In contrast, investors or other 
parties wishing to access and review paper filings must do so in person 
at the Commission's public reference room, or subscribe to a third-
party information service that scans and distributes the information 
after a paper filing is made. As such, it can be time consuming and/or 
costly to obtain these filings in paper.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ EDGAR filings are also available through some third-party 
information providers that obtain filings from EDGAR and disseminate 
them through their own websites.
    \4\ In this regard, the Commission's public reference room is 
currently closed in recognition of the health and safety concerns 
related to COVID-19. See infra note 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In 1993, when the Commission began to mandate the electronic filing 
of documents on EDGAR, it adopted Regulation S-T and other rule and 
form amendments to implement the operational phase of EDGAR.\5\ When 
the Commission adopted Regulation S-T it did not mandate electronic 
filing for all documents that are required to be filed under the 
Federal securities laws.\6\ Currently, 17 CFR 232.101(a) (``Rule 
101(a)'') mandates the electronic filing of over 400 different forms, 
schedules, reports, and applications. However, 17 CFR 232.101(b) 
(``Rule 101(b)'') identifies a number of documents that filers may 
choose (but are not required) to submit in electronic format via EDGAR 
and 17 CFR 232.101(c) (``Rule 101(c)'') identifies a number of 
documents that are not permitted to be filed in electronic format via 
EDGAR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \5\ See Rulemaking for EDGAR System, Release No. 33-6977 (Feb. 
23, 1993) [58 FR 14628].
    \6\ As one example, the Commission recognized that, at that 
time, certain documents, due to the graphical content or the format 
of data contained in the document, and the limitations of 
information technology, could be difficult to convert into an 
electronic format.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Since implementation of EDGAR, the Commission has increasingly 
sought to make the system more comprehensive by including more filings 
in the mandated electronic filing category. For example, in 2002, the 
Commission adopted amendments to require foreign private issuers and 
foreign governments to submit electronically via EDGAR many of the 
documents that they are required to file.\7\ In 2003,\8\ the Commission 
adopted rule and form amendments to mandate the electronic filing of 
Forms 3, 4, and 5.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ See Mandated EDGAR Filing for Foreign Issuers, Release No. 
33-8099 (May 14, 2002) [67 FR 36678].
    \8\ See Mandated Electronic Filing and website Posting for Forms 
3, 4 and 5, Release No. 33-8230 (May 7, 2003) [68 FR 25788].
    \9\ 17 CFR 249.103; 17 CFR 249.104; 17 CFR 232.105.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In furtherance of this objective, on November 4, 2021, we proposed 
amendments to update additional EDGAR filing requirements.\10\ 
Specifically, we proposed rule and form amendments that would: (1) 
mandate the electronic filing or submission of most of the documents 
that are currently permitted electronic submissions under Rule 101(b) 
of Regulation S-T; (2) mandate the electronic submission of

[[Page 35395]]

the ``glossy'' annual report to security holders; (3) mandate the 
electronic filing of the certification made pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 
78l(d) (``Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act'') and 17 CFR 240.12d1-3 
(``Exchange Act Rule 12d1-3'') that a security has been approved by an 
exchange for listing and registration; (4) mandate the use of Inline 
XBRL for the filing of the financial statements and accompanying notes 
to the financial statements required by Form 11-K; and (5) allow for 
the electronic submission of certain foreign language documents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See Updating EDGAR Filing Requirements Release No. 33-11005 
(Nov. 4, 2021) [86 FR 66231] (``Updating EDGAR Proposing Release'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, on December 22, 2020, as part of a broader rule 
proposal relating to 17 CFR 230.144 (``Rule 144''), we proposed to 
mandate electronic filing of Form 144 with respect to securities issued 
by issuers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) 
of the Exchange Act.\11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ See Rule 144 Holding Period and Form 144 Filings, Release 
No. 33-10991 (Dec. 22, 2020) [85 FR 79936] (``Rule 144 Proposing 
Release''). We are not taking any action concerning the remaining 
proposals in the Rule 144 Proposing Release at this time. In 
particular, we are not adopting the proposal to eliminate the Form 
144 filing requirement for the sale of securities of companies that 
are not subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) 
of the Exchange Act. As such, affiliates relying on Rule 144 when 
the issuer of the securities is not subject to the reporting 
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act will still 
be required to file a notice of sale on Form 144 in paper form 
pursuant to Rule 101(c)(6) of Regulation S-T and Rule 144. 
Accordingly, we are adopting a conforming amendment to Rule 144 (new 
Rule 144(h)(2)) to reflect that non-reporting issuers will continue 
to file in paper.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are now adopting amendments reflecting the above rule and form 
proposals, substantially as proposed. We believe that these changes 
will continue and further the Commission's ongoing efforts to make the 
EDGAR system more comprehensive by including more filings in the 
mandated electronic filing category.

II. Discussion of Final Amendments

A. Mandating the Electronic Filing or Submission of Permissible 
Electronic Submissions

    Rule 101(b) of Regulation S-T currently permits filers to submit 
the following documents either electronically or in paper format:
    <bullet> Annual reports to security holders (colloquially referred 
to as the ``glossy'' annual reports) furnished for the information of 
the Commission pursuant to 17 CFR 240.14a-3(c) (``Exchange Act Rule 
14a-3(c)'') or 17 CFR 240.14c-3(b) (``Exchange Act Rule 14c-3(b)''), or 
under the requirements of Form 10-K for registrants reporting pursuant 
to 15 U.S.C. 78o(d) (``Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act''),\12\ or by 
foreign private issuers on Form 6-K pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 17 
CFR 240.13a-16 or 17 CFR 240.15d-16;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \12\ In 2016, the Division of Corporation Finance indicated that 
it would not object if a registrant posts an electronic version of 
its ``glossy'' annual report to security holders to its corporate 
website by the applicable date specified in Exchange Act Rule 14a-
3(c), Exchange Act Rule 14c-3(b), or in Form 10-K, in lieu of 
mailing paper copies or submitting it on EDGAR if the report remains 
accessible for at least one year after posting. See Proxy Rules and 
Schedule 14A (Regarding Submission of Annual Reports to SEC Under 
Rules 14a-c(3) and 14c-3(b)), U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n (Nov. 2, 
2016), available under ``Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations--
Proxy Rules and Schedule 14A'' at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/exchange-act-rule-14a3-14c3.htm">https://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/exchange-act-rule-14a3-14c3.htm</a> (``2016 Staff 
Guidance''). The 2016 Staff Guidance will be withdrawn upon the 
compliance date of amended Rule 101(a)(1)(xxiii) of Regulation S-T 
as it is superseded by the rule amendments. EDGAR will serve as a 
repository for electronic copies of the ``glossy'' annual reports to 
security holders, whether or not registrants post the reports on 
their corporate websites.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Notices of exempt solicitation furnished for the 
information of the Commission pursuant to 17 CFR 240.14a-6(g), and 
notices of exempt preliminary roll-up communications furnished for the 
information of the Commission pursuant to 17 CFR 240.14a-6(n);
    <bullet> Annual reports for employee benefit plans on 17 CFR 
249.311 (``Form 11-K''); \13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ Registrants who satisfy their Form 11-K filing obligations 
by filing an amendment to Form 10-K, as provided by 17 CFR 240.15d-
21 (``Exchange Act Rule 15d-21'') Exchange Act Rule 15d-21, may also 
file these amendments in paper or electronic format.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Notice of proposed sale of securities on 17 CFR 239.144 
(``Form 144'') where the issuer of the securities is subject to the 
reporting requirements under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; 
\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ In April 2020, in recognition of several logistical 
difficulties related to the submission of Form 144 in paper pursuant 
to Rules 101(b)(4) or 101(c)(6) of Regulation S-T, as well as 
ongoing health and safety concerns related to COVID-19, the Division 
of Corporation Finance issued a statement announcing a temporary no-
action position that it would not recommend enforcement action to 
the Commission if Forms 144 for the period from and including April 
10, 2020 to June 30, 2020 were submitted as a complete PDF 
attachment and emailed to the Commission in lieu of filing the form 
in paper. Subsequently, on June 25, 2020, the Division of 
Corporation Finance indefinitely extended this statement from the 
period beginning on April 10, 2020. See Division of Corporation 
Finance Statement Regarding Requirements for Form 144 Paper Filings 
in Light of COVID-19 Concerns, U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm'n (June 25, 
2020), available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/announcement/form-144-paper-filings-email-option-update">https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/announcement/form-144-paper-filings-email-option-update</a>. The 2020 statement will be 
withdrawn upon the compliance date of amended Rules 144(h)(2) and 
101(a)(1)(xxvi) of Regulation S-T as it is no longer necessary due 
to the rule amendments.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Periodic reports and reports with respect to distributions 
of primary obligations filed by the International Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, 
the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the 
International Finance Corporation, or the European Bank for 
Reconstruction and Development (collectively, the ``Development 
Banks''); \15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \15\ Pursuant to rules adopted by the Commission, the 
Development Banks are required to file annual and quarterly reports 
with the Commission in connection with the distribution of primary 
obligations issued by the Development Banks. In addition, the 
Development Banks are required to file a distribution report with 
the Commission on or prior to the date on which any distribution of 
primary obligations are issued to the public in the United States. 
See 17 CFR 285-290.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> Reports or other documents submitted by a foreign private 
issuer under cover of 17 CFR 249.306 (``Form 6-K'') that the foreign 
private issuer must furnish and make public under the laws of the 
jurisdiction in which the issuer is incorporated, domiciled or legally 
organized (the foreign private issuer's ``home country''), or under the 
rules of the home country exchange on which the foreign private 
issuer's securities are traded, as long as the report or other document 
is not a press release, is not required to be and has not been 
distributed to the issuer's security holders, and, if discussing a 
material event, has already been the subject of a Form 6-K or other 
Commission filing or submission on EDGAR; and
    <bullet> Documents filed with the Commission pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 
80a-32 (``Section 33 of the Investment Company Act'').\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See Rule 101(b)(9) of Regulation S-T [17 CFR 
232.101(b)(9)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Proposing Releases
    In two separate rule proposals,\17\ we proposed to amend Rule 101 
of Regulation S-T to mandate the electronic filing of the documents 
listed above; all of which are currently permitted electronic filings 
under Rule 101(b).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ See the Updating EDGAR Proposing Release, supra note 10 and 
the Rule 144 Proposing Release, supra note 11.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the Updating EDGAR Proposing Release, we proposed amendments 
that would remove the permitted electronic submissions listed in Rule 
101(b)(1) through paragraph (b)(6), with the exception of current 
paragraph 101(b)(4) relating to Rule 144 filings, as well as paragraph 
(b)(9) \18\ and add those items

[[Page 35396]]

to the list of mandated electronic submissions contained in Rule 
101(a)(1) of Regulation S-T.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See in this regard Electronic Submission of Applications 
for Orders under the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, 
Confidential Treatment Requests for Filings on Form 13F, and Form 
ADV-NR; Amendments to Form 13F Release No. 34-93518 (Nov. 4, 2021) 
[86 FR 64839] in which we proposed to update the filing requirements 
for certain Investment Company Act and Investment Advisor Act forms 
and applications.
    \19\ In addition to the proposed changes to Rules 101(a) and 
101(b), in the Updating EDGAR Proposing Release we also proposed 
corresponding amendments to Rules 158, 306, 311, 405, 12d1-3, 14a-3 
and 14c-3, as well as Forms 6-K, 10-K, 11-K, 20-F, and 40-F to 
implement these changes. We are also adopting the corresponding 
changes as proposed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In the Rule 144 Proposing Release,\20\ we proposed to remove the 
permitted electronic submission of all Form 144 filings for the sale of 
securities of Exchange Act reporting companies in Rule 101(b)(4) of 
Regulation S-T and add that item to the list of mandated electronic 
submissions contained in Rule 101(a)(1) of Regulation S-T.\21\ We also 
proposed to amend Rule 144(h)(1) to delete the requirement that an 
affiliate send one copy of the Form 144 notice to the principal 
exchange, if any, on which the restricted securities are admitted to 
trading, as this provision was designed for paper Form 144 filings. We 
proposed to provide a six-month transition period after the effective 
date of the amendments to Regulation S-T to give Form 144 paper filers 
who would be first-time electronic filers on EDGAR sufficient time to 
apply for access to file on EDGAR. Additionally, the Rule 144 Proposing 
Release noted that we would make Form 144 available online as a 
fillable document that could be used by filers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \20\ Under Securities Act Rule 144(h), an affiliate who intends 
to resell restricted or control securities of the issuer in reliance 
upon Securities Act Rule 144 during any three-month period in a 
transaction that exceeds either 5,000 shares or has an aggregate 
sales price of more than $50,000 must file a Form 144 concurrently 
with either the placing of an order with a broker to execute the 
sale or the execution of a sale directly with a market maker. Rule 
101(b) of Regulation S-T permits Form 144 to be filed electronically 
or in paper if the issuer of the securities is subject to Exchange 
Act reporting requirements. In calendar year 2021, approximately 
30,000 Forms 144 were filed. Although the vast majority 
(approximately 99%, or 29,700) of these Form 144 filings can be made 
electronically on EDGAR (because the issuer of the securities is 
subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements), only 234 Form 144 
filings were electronically filed on EDGAR. The remainder were filed 
in paper or as a PDF via email. If the issuer of the securities is 
not subject to Exchange Act reporting requirements, Rule 101(c)(6) 
of Regulation S-T requires Form 144 to be filed in paper. See also 
supra note 17.
    \21\ We also proposed minor changes to Form 144 to update the 
form to reflect these changes and to eliminate certain personally 
identifiable information (``PII'') and immaterial information fields 
that are unnecessary. Specifically, we proposed to delete the fields 
requiring the home address of the person for whose account the 
securities are to be sold and the IRS identification number of the 
issuer of the securities. For purposes of Form 144, we have 
determined that we can achieve our regulatory objectives without the 
PII. Furthermore, the IRS identification number of the issuer is 
redundant as this information is required to be disclosed on the 
cover page of registration statements and periodic reports and would 
be available through these forms. We are also adopting these changes 
as proposed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Public Comments
    We received eight comment letters on the Updating EDGAR Proposing 
Release. One was supportive of the mandate to make the glossy annual 
report a mandatory EDGAR filing; \22\ two addressed the electronic 
filing of forms that were not part of the proposal; \23\ one addressed 
substantive disclosure requirements not addressed in, and beyond the 
scope of, the proposal,\24\ one addressed a filing process that was not 
proposed,\25\ and one requested a longer comment period.\26\ We did not 
receive any comments opposing this proposal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See letter dated Dec. 2, 2021 from Parker Smith.
    \23\ See letter dated Dec. 17, 2021 from Dorothy Donohue, Deputy 
General Counsel--Securities Regulation, Investment Company Institute 
and letter dated Dec. 17, 2021 from Martha Redding, Associate 
General Counsel, Assistant Secretary, NYSE Group, Inc.
    \24\ See letter dated Jan. 4, 2022 from Andrew MacInnes, 
BrilLiquid LLC.
    \25\ See letter dated Nov. 17, 2021 from Joseph Snyder.
    \26\ See letter dated Jan. 10, 2022 from Patrick McHenry, 
Ranking Member, House Committee on Financial Services, and Pat 
Toomey, Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs. Neither of the remaining two letters addressed 
mandating electronic filings. One noted that ``people everywhere 
deserve free and open markets,'' and another requested that the 
Commission ``shut down dark pools.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We received twelve comment letters on the Rule 144 Proposing 
Release addressing the proposed amendment to mandate electronic filing 
of Form 144, most of which expressed support for mandating the 
electronic filing of Form 144. For example, several of these commenters 
stated that proposed amendments would allow for a more convenient and 
improved filing process.\27\ A number of commenters noted that filing 
Form 144 in paper makes it difficult for investors and other users of 
the disclosures (such as researchers and other regulatory bodies) to 
access the information contained in these filings.\28\

Co-Director of Cambridge Centre for Financial Reporting & 
Accountability, and letter dated Mar. 10, 2021 from David Larcker, 
Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Director, Stanford

    One commenter stated that the importance of the information 
contained in Form 144 is demonstrated by the activities of third party 
vendors that regularly visit the Commission's Reading Room to scan, 
digitize, and disseminate Forms 144 to clients that pay for the 
information.\29\ This commenter stated the Commission's Form 144 paper 
filing regime has created a two-tiered disclosure system that makes 
public disclosure of Form 144 essentially only accessible to large 
institutional clients that have the resources pay for this information, 
but inaccessible to individual investors.\30\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Another commenter, although supportive of the goals of this 
proposal, expressed concern that the proposed amendments would present 
significant logistical challenges for broker-dealers that prepare and 
submit Form 144 filings on behalf of their clients and may result in 
firms deciding to cease providing such services.\31\ This commenter 
stated that mandating the electronic filing of Form 144 will require 
firms to log-in and log-out of the SEC's system using a Form 144 
filer's EDGAR credentials, ``which will be extremely time-consuming and 
labor-intensive'' given the number of Form 144 filings that this 
commenter indicated are filed by broker-dealers.\32\ This commenter 
also stated that an electronic filing mandate would require a brokerage 
firm to develop and maintain processes to collect, securely store, and 
properly update all of the EDGAR access credentials for each of its 
clients that are required to file a Form 144. This commenter 
recommended, as an alternative, that the Commission adopt an approach 
that would allow brokerage firms to bulk file Forms 144 on a daily or 
every-other-business-day basis (or whatever time period the Commission 
considers appropriate) and that the Commission also provide a twelve-
month transition period.\33\

2. Final Rules
    After considering the public comments, we are adopting the

[[Page 35397]]

amendments to mandate electronic filing as proposed, with the exception 
of the compliance date for the electronic filing of Form 144, which is 
discussed further in Section II.F, below. We believe that mandating the 
electronic filing of these documents will benefit investors and other 
users by making the information contained in these filings accessible 
to the public almost immediately after filing on EDGAR. It will thus 
enable investors, market participants, and other EDGAR users to 
retrieve and use the information in these documents promptly, as 
compared to a paper filing, facilitating their analysis of this 
information. The use of EDGAR will also facilitate efficient storage of 
this information, improve the Commission's ability to track and process 
filings, and modernize the Commission's records management process. 
Moreover, eliminating the permitted electronic submissions of documents 
that are filed or furnished pursuant to Rules 101(b)(1)-(3), (5), (6) 
and (9) will eliminate a paper option that as a practical matter is not 
used by the vast majority of registrants.\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ For example, in calendar years 2020 and 2021 combined, 
there were more than 48,000 Forms 6-Ks filed electronically and only 
two filed in paper. Similarly, for the same two-year period, there 
were approximately 20,000 Forms 11-K filed electronically and only 
22 filed in paper. See also infra note 42.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, Form 144 filers will benefit from the planned changes 
to make the form an online fillable document that would facilitate 
electronic filing. An online fillable form will enable the convenient 
input of information, and support the electronic assembly of such 
information and transmission to EDGAR, without requiring a Form 144 
filer to purchase or maintain additional software or technology. The 
fillable form will be similar to other fillable forms that are 
currently available to file other Form-specific XML filings on EDGAR 
such as Forms D, 3, 4, and 5.\35\ As such, the Form 144 data will be 
machine-readable and thus available for automated and efficient 
analysis.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ We are also adopting the proposed amendment to Rule 
144(h)(1) to delete the requirement that an affiliate send one copy 
of the Form 144 notice to the principal exchange, if any, on which 
the restricted securities are admitted to trading. This requirement 
was designed for paper Form 144 filings and will no longer be 
necessary now that we are mandating the electronic filing of Form 
144.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We acknowledge the concerns voiced by one commenter about potential 
logistical challenges for brokers and dealers.\36\ We note that EDGAR 
allows for bulk filing of forms, including forms for multiple different 
CIKs, simultaneously. As such, a single broker-dealer could bulk file 
Forms 144 simultaneously for multiple clients.\37\ In addition, we are 
providing a longer transition period than what was proposed for Form 
144 paper filers to file the forms electronically on EDGAR. 
Specifically, we are adopting a six-month transition period commencing 
from the date when the Commission adopts a version of the EDGAR Filer 
Manual that addresses the updates to Form 144.\38\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ See supra note 31.
    \37\ In addition, the Commission recently issued a request for 
comment regarding potential technical changes to EDGAR filer access 
and filer account management processes. The request for comment may 
be relevant to the commenter's concerns about managing the EDGAR 
accounts of multiple Form 144 filers, for which broker-dealers would 
provide filing services. See Request for Comment on Potential 
Technical Changes to EDGAR Filer Access and Filer Account Management 
Processes, Release No. 34-93204 (Sept. 30, 2021) [86 FR 55029]; see 
also <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filer-information/edgar-next">https://www.sec.gov/edgar/filer-information/edgar-next</a>.
    \38\ See infra Section II.F.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Mandating the Electronic Submission of the ``Glossy'' Annual Report 
to Security Holders

    Exchange Act Rules 14a-3(c) and 14c-3(b) require registrants 
subject to these rules to furnish to the Commission, for its 
information, seven copies of their ``glossy'' annual report to security 
holders.\39\ Form 10-K contains a similar provision that requires 
registrants that are required to file a Form 10-K pursuant to Section 
15(d) of the Exchange Act to furnish to the Commission four copies of 
their ``glossy'' annual report to security holders.\40\ In addition, 
foreign private issuers are often required to furnish to the Commission 
their ``glossy'' annual report to security holders in response to the 
requirements of Form 6-K.\41\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ In 1967, the Commission amended Exchange Act Rules 14a-3(c) 
and 14c-3(b) to require registrants to furnish to the Commission, 
solely for its information, seven copies of their ``glossy'' annual 
report to security holders. See Proxy and Stockholder Information 
Rules, Release No. 34-8029 (Jan. 24, 1967) [32 FR 1035]. Prior to 
these amendments, registrants were required to furnish to the 
Commission four copies of their ``glossy'' annual report to security 
holders.
    \40\ See Form 10-K, Supplemental Information to be Furnished 
With Reports Filed Pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Act by 
Registrants Which Have Not Registered Securities Pursuant to Section 
12 of the Act. Form 10-K also currently requires registrants 
required to file a Form 10-K pursuant to Section 15(d) of the 
Exchange Act to furnish to the Commission every proxy statement, 
form of proxy or other proxy soliciting material sent to more than 
ten of the registrant's security holders with respect to any annual 
or other meeting of security holders.
    \41\ See supra Section II.A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Rule 101(b)(1) of Regulation S-T permits all of these registrants 
to satisfy the above requirements by submitting to the Commission their 
``glossy'' annual report to security holders in either paper or 
electronically on EDGAR. During the 2020 and 2021 calendar years, we 
received minimal paper submissions and very few electronic submissions 
of annual reports.\42\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ We received 23 and 18 electronic submissions of glossy 
annual reports in calendar years 2020 and 2021, respectively. The 
staff no longer tallies the number of these reports submitted in 
paper format. We believe, however, that the number is minimal as 
issuers typically avail themselves of the 2016 Staff Guidance. See 
supra note 12 (discussing the 2016 Staff Guidance regarding a 
registrant posting an electronic version of its ``glossy'' annual 
report to security holders to its corporate website in lieu of 
mailing paper copies or submitting it on EDGAR).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We proposed to require registrants to submit to the Commission 
their ``glossy'' annual report to security holders via an electronic 
submission on EDGAR, in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual, by 
adding Rule 101(a)(1)(xxiii) of Regulation S-T and removing Rule 
101(b)(1) of Regulation S-T.\43\ Registrants would no longer be 
permitted to submit their ``glossy'' annual report to security holders 
to the Commission in paper.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \43\ We also proposed corresponding amendments to Rules 14a-
3(c), 14c-3(b), and 158(b)(2), as well as Forms 20-F, 6-K and 10-K 
to implement these changes and are adopting these changes as 
proposed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are now adopting the amendments as proposed. We believe the 
requirements to furnish these reports to the Commission in paper format 
under Exchange Act Rule 14a-3(c), Exchange Act Rule 14c-3(b) and Form 
10-K are unnecessary. We also believe that, in addition to helping 
inform the Commission, investors will benefit from the ability to 
access electronic copies of the ``glossy'' annual reports to security 
holders on EDGAR.
    Going forward, EDGAR will serve as a repository for electronic 
copies of the ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders, whether or 
not registrants decide to post the reports on their corporate 
websites.\44\ An archive of electronic copies of the ``glossy'' annual 
reports to security holders will ensure long-term access to these 
reports in a centralized database available to the public and will 
avoid the burden for investors of having to search individual corporate 
websites and other resources for this information. In addition, 
electronic submission of the ``glossy'' annual report to security 
holders should capture the graphics, styles of presentation, and 
prominence of disclosures (including text size, placement, color, and 
offset, as applicable) contained in the reports.\45\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \44\ See supra note 12 (these amendments will supersede the 2016 
Staff Guidance, which will be withdrawn).
    \45\ Under the amendments, the ``glossy'' annual report to 
security holders should not be re-formatted, re-sized, or otherwise 
re-designed for purposes of the submission on EDGAR. Currently, the 
only format that EDGAR supports is portable data format (``PDF''). 
If EDGAR is upgraded to accommodate other formats appropriate for 
electronic filing of the ``glossy'' annual report, the Commission 
will communicate the upgrade by adopting an updated EDGAR Filer 
Manual that supports such formats.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[Page 35398]]

    In addition to deleting Rule 101(b)(1) of Regulation S-T, we are 
also amending Exchange Act Rule 14a-3(c), Exchange Act Rule 14c-3(b), 
and Form 10-K to eliminate the option for registrants to furnish to the 
Commission paper copies of their ``glossy'' annual report to security 
holders. Instead, we are requiring the electronic submission of these 
reports in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual. We are also amending 
Securities Act Rule 158(b)(2) to replace the reference to the 
furnishing of copies of the ``glossy'' annual report to security 
holders to the Commission with a reference to furnishing the report to 
the Commission in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ See 17 CFR 230.158(b)(2) (``Securities Act Rule 
158(b)(2)'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Notwithstanding these amendments, our proxy rules will continue to 
require certain registrants subject to the proxy rules to publish their 
``glossy'' annual report to security holders on a website other than 
the Commission's website.\47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \47\ See Exchange Act Rule 14a-16(b) [17 CFR 240.14a-16]; see 
also Shareholder Choice Regarding Proxy Materials, Exchange Act 
Release No. 34-56135 (July 26, 2007) [72 FR 42222].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to foreign private issuers, we are similarly amending 
Form 6-K to remove references to the paper submission to the Commission 
of a ``glossy'' annual report to security holders and instead will 
require foreign private issuers to satisfy their Form 6-K requirement 
to furnish such a report by submitting the report electronically on 
EDGAR, in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual.

C. Requiring the Electronic Filing of Certifications of Approval of 
Exchange Listing

    For securities to be listed on an exchange, Exchange Act Rule 12d1-
3 requires the national securities exchange to file a certification 
with the Commission that the security has been approved by the exchange 
for listing and registration pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange 
Act.\48\ The certification must specify (1) the approval of the 
exchange for listing and registration; (2) the title of the security so 
approved; (3) the date of filing with the exchange of the application 
for registration and of any amendments thereto; and (4) any conditions 
imposed on such certification.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ Exchange Act Rule 12d1-3(c) specifies that the 
certification may be made by telegram but in such case must be 
confirmed in writing, and all certifications in writing and all 
amendments thereto must be filed with the Commission in duplicate.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This certification is not included in any of the EDGAR filing 
requirements or exceptions in Rule 101 of Regulation S-T. In December 
2017, the Commission modified EDGAR to permit the voluntary electronic 
submission of the certifications on EDGAR.\49\ During the 2020 calendar 
year, the Commission received 1,184 certifications from national 
securities exchanges. All of the certifications were submitted 
electronically, except one. In light of the overwhelming use of this 
option, we proposed to amend Exchange Act Rule 12d1-3 and Rule 101(a) 
of Regulation S-T to mandate the electronic filing of these 
certifications. We received no comments on this aspect of the proposed 
amendments. We are adopting the amendments as proposed.\50\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \49\ Among other things, EDGAR Release 17.4 updated EDGAR to 
allow, but not require, national securities exchanges to submit a 
new certification form type on EDGAR to evidence the approval of 
securities for listing on an exchange. See Adoption of Updated EDGAR 
Filer Manual, Release No. 33-10444 (Dec. 8, 2017) [83 FR 2369]. 
Prior to the 2017 modification, we received only paper 
certifications that a security has been approved for listing and 
registration.
    \50\ Amended Rule 101(a) of Regulation S-T will require the 
filing of the certification electronically as is currently 
permitted.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Mandating the Use of Inline XBRL for the Filing of Financial 
Statements and Accompanying Notes to the Financial Statements Required 
by Form 11-K

    In 2009, the Commission adopted rules requiring operating companies 
to submit the information from the financial statements included in 
certain registration statements and periodic and current reports in a 
structured, machine-readable data language using XBRL.\51\ In 2018, the 
Commission adopted modifications to these requirements by requiring 
issuers to use Inline XBRL, which is both machine-readable and human-
readable, to reduce the time and effort associated with preparing XBRL 
filings and improve the quality and usability of XBRL data for 
investors.\52\ Since then, the Commission has completed phasing-in the 
adopted Inline XBRL requirements and has expanded the scope of 
disclosures that must be tagged using Inline XBRL.\53\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ See Interactive Data to Improve Financial Reporting, 
Securities Act Release No. 9002 (Jan. 30, 2009) [74 FR 6776 2009)] 
(requiring submission of an Interactive Data File to the Commission 
in exhibits to such reports); see also Securities Act Release No. 
9002A (Apr. 1, 2009) [74 FR 15666)].
    \52\ See Inline XBRL Filing of Tagged Data, Securities Act 
Release No. 10514 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR 40846, 40847] (``Inline 
XBRL Adopting Release''). Inline XBRL allows filers to embed XBRL 
data directly into an HTML document, eliminating the need to tag a 
copy of the information in a separate XBRL exhibit. Inline XBRL is 
both human-readable and machine-readable for purposes of validation, 
aggregation, and analysis. Id at 40851.
    \53\ See, e.g., Filing Fee Disclosure and Payment Methods 
Modernization, Release No. 33-10997 (Oct. 13, 2021) [86 FR 770166].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Form 11-K is the form used for annual reports of employee stock 
purchase, savings and similar plans that are filed with the Commission 
pursuant to Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Currently, annual 
reports on Form 11-K are not subject to structured data reporting 
requirements. Accordingly, the financial statements required by Form 
11-K are not machine-readable. These financial statements, which must 
be prepared in accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 6A 
of Regulation S-X (17 CFR 210.6A-01-.6A-05), include:
    <bullet> An audited statement of financial condition as of the end 
of the latest two fiscal years of the plan (or such lesser period as 
the plan has been in existence); and
    <bullet> An audited statement of comprehensive income (either in a 
single continuous financial statement or in two separate but 
consecutive financial statements; or a statement of net income if there 
was no other comprehensive income) and changes in plan equity for each 
of the latest three fiscal years of the plan (or such lesser period as 
the plan has been in existence.
    Form 11-K also provides filers with the option to file plan 
financial statements and schedules prepared in accordance with the 
financial reporting requirements of 29 U.S.C. 18 et seq. (the 
``Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974'' or ``ERISA'').\54\ 
When filers elect this option, plan financial statements are embedded 
within the filing or filed as exhibits in a non-structured format.\55\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ 29 U.S.C. 18 et seq. Plan financial statements required 
under ERISA are prepared on Form 5500. See Form 5500, Annual Return/
Report of Employee Benefit Plan, available at <a href="https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/reporting-and-filing/form-5500/2020-form-5500.pdf">https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/EBSA/employers-and-advisers/plan-administration-and-compliance/reporting-and-filing/form-5500/2020-form-5500.pdf</a>.
    \55\ Under paragraph 4 of Required Information of Form 11-K, 
plans may include all or a portion of Form 5500 into the Form 11-K 
filing with the Commission.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We proposed to require registrants to present the financial 
information required by Form 11-K, whether prepared in accordance with 
Regulation S-X or the financial reporting requirements of ERISA, in 
Inline XBRL.\56\ Under the proposed amendments the tagging requirement 
for

[[Page 35399]]

annual reports on Form 11-K would mirror the Inline XBRL requirements 
for financial information contained in annual reports on Forms 10-K, 
20-F, and 40-F. As such, every data point in the financial statements 
required by Form 11-K would be tagged in Inline XBRL. Further, where 
there are narrative disclosures (e.g., notes to the financial 
statements), registrants would be required, like filers of Forms 10-K, 
20-F, and 40-F, to apply block tags to the narrative disclosures and 
detailed tags to any numeric amounts presented in the narrative text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \56\ See supra Note 13. The proposed amendments would also apply 
to financial statements required by Form 11-K that are filed in 
accordance with Exchange Act Rule 15d-21.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We received no comments on this aspect of the proposal and are 
adopting these amendments as proposed.\57\ Structuring this data will 
enable analytical tools to extract tagged information in an efficient, 
automated manner. As a result, plan participants, analysts, and the 
Commission will be better able to access, organize, and evaluate the 
information presented by filers. As amended, the tagging requirement 
will be specified in the Instructions to Form 11-K and in Rule 405 of 
Regulation S-T.\58\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \57\ As discussed in Section II.A., supra, we are also mandating 
the electronic submission of Form 11-K.
    \58\ We are not adopting the proposed changes to the definition 
of Related Official Filing in Rule 11 of Regulation S-T. We have 
determined that it is not necessary to change that definition, as 
the amendments to Rule 405 of Regulation S-T that we are adopting 
are sufficient to reflect this new requirement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

E. Electronic Submission of Certain Foreign Language Documents

    Generally, all filings and submissions to the Commission must be in 
English.\59\ Rule 306(a) of Regulation S-T prohibits the electronic 
filing or submission of a document that is in a foreign language.\60\ 
If an electronic filing or submission requires the inclusion of a 
foreign language document, the document must either be translated into, 
or (if it is an exhibit or attachment to a filing or submission) 
summarized in English and submitted in electronic format.\61\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \59\ See 17 CFR 230.403; 17 CFR 240.12b-12; and Rule 306 of 
Regulation S-T.
    \60\ Rule 306(d) of Regulation S-T provides for one exception to 
Rule 306(a) and allows for the electronic filing of certain 
documents that contain both French and English by Canadian issuers 
[17 CFR 232.306(d)].
    \61\ See 17 CFR 230.403(c); 17 CFR 240.12b-12(d); and 17 CFR 
232.306(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Currently, Rules 306(b) and (c) of Regulation S-T govern the 
submission of a foreign language document by an electronic filer.\62\ 
Rule 306(b) permits the paper submission of an unabridged foreign 
language document if an English translation or summary of that document 
has already been provided in an electronic filing or submission. Rule 
306(c) requires the paper submission of a foreign language version of a 
foreign government or its political subdivision's latest annual budget 
if an English translation of the budget is unavailable and such an 
exhibit is required by Form 18 or Form 18-K. We proposed to amend Rule 
306 to eliminate paper submission of the above two types of foreign 
language documents.\63\ Instead, these documents would be required to 
be submitted electronically in an appropriate format that EDGAR 
supports, currently as PDFs.\64\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ Currently, electronic filers may not submit these 
untranslated foreign language documents in electronic format. 17 CFR 
232.101(c)(8) (``Rule 101(c)(8) of Regulation S-T'') states that 
documents and symbols in a foreign language shall not be submitted 
in electronic format and, thus, may only be submitted in paper.
    \63\ We also proposed to amend Rule 311 of Regulation S-T and 
Form SE to clarify that these two types of foreign language 
documents may no longer be submitted in paper under the cover of 
Form SE. We are adopting these amendments as proposed.
    \64\ We similarly proposed to remove and reserve Rule 101(c)(8) 
of Regulation S-T. As noted above, Rule 101(c)(8) prohibits the 
electronic submission of documents and symbols in a foreign 
language. We are also adopting this amendment as proposed. We note 
in this regard that even with the removal of this prohibition, Rule 
306(a) of Regulation S-T will still generally require all electronic 
filings and submissions to be in English.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We did not receive any comments on these amendments and are now 
adopting these amendments as proposed. We believe that these changes 
will reduce the number of paper submissions we receive and increase the 
public's access to these foreign language documents.

F. Transition Periods

    We are adopting the proposed six-month transition period after the 
effective date of the amendments for when filers will be required to 
file or submit electronically ``glossy'' annual reports to security 
holders (in PDF), notices of exempt solicitations and exempt 
preliminary roll-up communications, annual reports for employee benefit 
plans on Form 11-K, periodic reports and reports with respect to 
distributions of primary obligations filed by the Development Banks, 
reports or other documents submitted by a foreign private issuer under 
cover of Form 6-K, certain foreign language documents (in PDF), and 
certifications made pursuant to the Exchange Act and its rules that a 
security has been approved by an exchange for listing and registration. 
We believe that this transition period will provide registrants with 
sufficient time to prepare to submit these documents electronically in 
accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual, including providing paper 
filers who would be first-time EDGAR filers adequate time to apply for 
access to file on EDGAR on behalf of their clients and/or apply for a 
filing agent CIK in order to make electronic filings.
    In response to the comment requesting a longer transition period to 
allow a firm to collect EDGAR filing credentials from its Form 144 
filing clients and to establish adequate new processes governing the 
filing of the forms and the maintenance of EDGAR credentials,\65\ we 
are adopting a longer transition period than what we proposed for when 
filers will be required to file Forms 144 on EDGAR for sales of 
securities of issuers subject to the reporting requirements of Section 
13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Specifically, the requirement to file 
Form 144 electronically on EDGAR will commence six months from the date 
of publication in the Federal Register of the Commission release that 
adopts the version of the EDGAR Filer Manual addressing updates to Form 
144. We currently expect that the Commission would consider adoption of 
the relevant version of the EDGAR Filer Manual addressing updates to 
Form 144 in September 2022, and publication in the Federal Register 
would occur thereafter. We believe this extended transition period will 
provide sufficient time for broker-dealers to transition clients for 
whom they prepare and submit Form 144 filings, including time for those 
clients who do not currently have access to EDGAR to apply for EDGAR 
access.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \65\ See supra note 31.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are providing Form 11-K filers a three-year transition period 
after the effective date of the amendments in which to comply with the 
requirement to submit the financial statements and accompanying notes 
to the financial statements required by Form 11-K in Inline XBRL. We 
believe that a three-year transition period will provide employee stock 
purchase, savings and similar plans with sufficient time to prepare for 
Inline XBRL submissions taking into account that such registrants are 
not currently obligated to submit any information in XBRL or Inline 
XBRL.\66\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \66\ In this regard, the three-year transition period is 
consistent with the transition times provided in other rules where 
registrants would be newly obligated to tag financial information in 
Inline XBRL. See, e.g., Inline XBRL Filing of Tagged Data, 
Securities Act Release No. 10514 (June 28, 2018) [83 FR 40846, 
40847].

III. Other Matters

    If any of the provisions of these rules, or the application thereof 
to any person

[[Page 35400]]

or circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not 
affect other provisions or application of such provisions to other 
persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid 
provision or application.
    Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, the Office of Information 
and Regulatory Affairs has designated these rules not a ``major rule,'' 
as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

IV. Economic Analysis

A. Introduction

    The Commission is adopting rule and form amendments to update 
filing requirements under the EDGAR system. We are mindful of the costs 
imposed by, and the benefits obtained from, our rules and the 
amendments.\67\ The discussion below addresses the potential economic 
effects of the amendments. These effects include the likely benefits 
and costs of the amendments and reasonable alternatives thereto, as 
well as any potential effects on efficiency, competition, and capital 
formation. We attempt to quantify these economic effects whenever 
possible; however, due to data limitations, we are unable to do so in 
many cases. For example, we are unable to quantify the value to the 
public of being able to more quickly access a document on EDGAR 
compared to accessing it on paper. When we cannot provide a 
quantitative assessment, we provide a qualitative discussion of the 
economic effects instead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \67\ Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] and 
Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. 78c(f)] require us, when 
engaging in rulemaking that requires us to consider or determine 
whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public 
interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, 
whether the action will promote efficiency, competition and capital 
formation. In addition, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act [15 
U.S.C. 78w(a)(2)] requires us to consider the effects on competition 
of any rules that the Commission adopts under the Exchange Act and 
prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the purposes of the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is adopting these rule and form amendments to 
facilitate the efficient submission of documents to the Commission; to 
reduce burdens and inefficiencies associated with the filing, 
dissemination, storage, and retrieval of non-electronic and paper 
submissions; to allow for quicker public access to information; to 
improve the Commission's ability to track and process such filings; and 
to modernize the Commission's records management processes.
    The rule and form amendments would:
    <bullet> Mandate the electronic filing of several documents that 
are currently permitted electronic submissions under Regulation S-T, 
including all filings on Form 6-K and filings made by Development 
Banks;
    <bullet> Mandate that certain registrants electronically file their 
``glossy'' annual report to security holders;
    <bullet> Mandate the electronic filing of the certification made 
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 
12d1-3 that a security has been approved by an exchange for listing and 
registration;
    <bullet> Mandate the electronic filing of Form 144 and remove the 
requirement that an affiliate send one copy of the Form 144 notice to 
the principal exchange, if any, on which the restricted securities are 
admitted to trading.
    <bullet> Mandate the use of the Inline XBRL structured data 
language for annual financial statements and schedules for employee 
benefit plans required by Form 11-K; and
    <bullet> Allow for the electronic submission format of certain 
foreign language documents and remove the option to submit these 
documents in paper.

B. Economic Baseline

    The economic baseline, from which we measure the likely economic 
effects of the amendments, reflects current regulatory practice as it 
pertains to the method of submission to the Commission of certain forms 
and documents that currently may be, but are not required to be, 
submitted to the Commission via EDGAR.
    Filers currently have the option to submit the following documents 
electronically via EDGAR: Annual reports to security holders furnished 
for the information of the Commission; \68\ notices of exempt 
solicitation furnished for the information of the Commission pursuant 
to Exchange Act Rule 14a-6(g) and notices of exempt preliminary roll-up 
communications furnished for the information of the Commission pursuant 
to Exchange Act Rule 14a-6(n); annual reports for employee benefit 
plans on Form 11-K; Form 144 for sales of securities of issuers subject 
to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange 
Act; certain reports from Development Banks; reports or other documents 
submitted by a foreign private issuer under cover of Form 6-K; 
documents filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 33 of the 
Investment Company Act; and certifications made pursuant to Section 
12(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 12d1-3 that a security 
has been approved by an exchange for listing and registration. In 
addition, annual reports for employee benefit plans on Form 11-K 
currently are not required to be submitted using the Inline XBRL 
structured data language.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \68\ See supra note 12.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For certain forms with an electronic filing option via EDGAR, a 
large percentage of filers use that option. Indeed, in Calendar Year 
(CY) 2021, the Commission received over 25,000 submissions combined of 
the following documents: Form 6-K, notices of exempt solicitation 
furnished for the information of the Commission pursuant to Rule 14a-
6(g), and annual reports on Form 11-K. For forms 6-K and 11-K, more 
than 99 percent of submissions were filed electronically on EDGAR, even 
though filers had the option to submit these documents in non-
electronic format. Likewise, in CY 2021 nearly all of the 
certifications filed by an exchange pursuant to Section 12(d) of the 
Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 12d1-3, and all documents filed 
pursuant to Section 33 of the Investment Company Act were submitted 
electronically on EDGAR, even though these documents could have been 
submitted in non-electronic format.
    In contrast, for two of the types of forms, a much smaller 
percentage of filers currently submit electronically via EDGAR. In CY 
2021, Development Banks electronically filed on EDGAR just 46 reports 
(34 percent).\69\ In CY 2021 Form 144 filers electronically submitted 
234 filings (0.8 percent) on EDGAR. Similarly, only a minimal number of 
``glossy'' annual reports to security holders were submitted to the 
Commission in 2021; of those, very few were submitted electronically to 
the Commission, and even fewer were filed in paper format.\70\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \69\ Among the Development Banks, there were six unique filers.
    \70\ See supra note 42.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Existing Commission rules permit Form 144 to be submitted either 
electronically via EDGAR or in paper form only for forms reporting 
proposed sales of reporting issuers. In 2020, in response to COVID-19 
conditions, Commission staff announced a no-action position that 
temporarily affords Form 144 filers a third option to submit paper Form 
144s via email.\71\ In CY 2021, using a full year of data following the 
announcement, the Commission received 30,021 Form 144 submissions: 52.9 
percent in paper form, 46.3 percent electronically via email, and 0.8 
percent electronically on EDGAR. Thus, while when given the option, 
many paper

[[Page 35401]]

filers have elected to submit their forms via email, very few filers 
have opted to file Form 144 electronically on EDGAR. Figure 1 examines 
the lag between when the Commission received a Form 144 filing and when 
it appeared in a commercial database, a proxy for the speed of 
dissemination to the public, for 2019 and 2021.\72\ More specifically, 
the figure displays frequency counts of this dissemination lag (in 
days) for 2019 and 2021, before and after the announcement that filers 
could submit Form 144 via email. After the Commission allowed Form 144 
to be submitted by email, the dissemination lag shortened (a leftward 
shift in the count distribution) by 1 day (16 percent) for the median 
submission, suggesting shifting away from the submission of paper Form 
144 submissions improves the speed of dissemination. Electronic filings 
on EDGAR would likely further reduce the dissemination lag in Form 144 
filings as they would be made public more quickly relative to the 
processing of electronic PDFs by third-party data providers.\73\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \71\ See supra note 14.
    \72\ The chart does not include 2020 as financial market 
conditions and broader logistical difficulties surrounding COVID-19 
pandemic may be a confounding factor for 2020 data. Furthermore, 
comparing a full year of data for 2021 relative to 2019 means that 
seasonality effects do not affect our estimates. In contrast, 
estimates that compare data before and after the April 2020 
Commission announcement that filers could submit Form 144 via email 
may be correlated with seasonality effects.
    \73\ Based on Form 144 filings accessed via Thomson Reuters 
Insiders Data with the field ``SEC Receipt'' dated in 2019 or 2021.
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR10JN22.008

    For Form 144 filers, it is our understanding that the majority of 
affected filers currently prepare and file these forms individually or 
with the assistance of a broker or personal counsel.\74\ As the 
majority of Form 144 filings are currently paper or email filings, most 
filers would have to modify their processes for submitting their Form 
144 filings under the amendments. Based on past filings, we estimate 
that approximately 12,250 filers would be required to switch to 
electronic filings on EDGAR.\75\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \74\ See letter from Jesse Brill (dated Dec. 18, 2013), 
available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-671.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-671.pdf</a>; 
see also letter dated Mar. 22, 2021 from the Securities Industry and 
Financial Markets Association.
    \75\ These estimates assume that filers of Form 144 submissions 
in our data are not also affiliates of other issuers. Because we 
lack data on the holdings of filers in securities of issuers other 
than those disclosed in the Form 144, we are unable to identify any 
filers that are such affiliates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, for Commission staff, receiving and processing paper or 
email submissions is often more time intensive than processing 
electronic submissions on EDGAR. When the Commission receives a paper 
or email submission, the document usually requires several manual 
steps, involving staff in various offices and divisions to process and 
retain the documents for recordkeeping purposes. As less than one 
percent of all Form 144 submissions per year are filed electronically 
on EDGAR, the amended rules will likely increase significantly the 
volume of Form 144 filings made electronically on EDGAR and thus will 
reduce staff processing time.\76\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \76\ A rate of change based on the current one percent EDGAR 
submission rate may slightly overestimate the changes in volume. 
Further, based on the observed EDGAR filing behavior of affiliates 
who use an issuer's existing access to EDGAR, the number of new Form 
IDs required to be processed could be reduced, but would not 
otherwise affect the increase in submission volume.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Economic Effects

    This section discusses the benefits and costs of the rule and form 
amendments, as well as their potential effects on efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation. Some of the amendments reflect 
current practice,\77\ so they will likely not have significant economic 
effects. In addition, where certain benefits or costs of electronic 
filing apply to multiple amendments,

[[Page 35402]]

we discuss those benefits or costs together instead of repeating such 
discussion for each amendment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \77\ For example, certain amendments that would mandate 
electronic filings for specific documents, like listing 
certifications, that are currently largely submitted electronically.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We recognize that the potential costs and benefits of electronic 
filing are sensitive to various assumptions, including the number of 
affected filers; the time burden of filing using EDGAR, including the 
type and cost of staff used, if any; and printing and mailing costs 
incurred under current rules. The economic effects on individual filers 
may vary across all filers depending on variables such as filer size, 
number of filings submitted, existing filing practices (e.g., current 
reliance on electronic document preparation; current experience with 
using EDGAR; use of in-house staff, brokers, or outside counsel for 
filing; number, types, and cost of in-house staff involved in paper 
filing; actual hours and printing and mailing costs required for paper 
filings). They may also vary depending on the amount of time required 
for filers to be trained in the use of EDGAR and any required related 
processes, and the amount of time to resolve any technical issues 
related to electronic filing on EDGAR.
1. Benefits
a. Electronic Submission of Form 6-K, Notices of Exempt Solicitation, 
Notices of Exempt Preliminary Roll-Up, Annual Reports on Form 11-K, 
Form 144, Development Bank Reports, Certifications of Approval of 
Exchange Listing, and Certain Foreign Language Documents
    Currently, filers have the option to electronically submit in 
EDGAR, among other things, documents under cover of Form 6-K, notices 
of exempt solicitation furnished for the information of the Commission 
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-6(g), notices of exempt preliminary 
roll-up communications furnished for the information of the Commission 
pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 14a-6(n), annual reports for employee 
benefit plans on Form 11-K, Form 144 for securities of reporting 
issuers, periodic reports and reports with respect to distributions of 
primary obligations from Development Banks, certifications made 
pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 
12d1-3 that a security has been approved by an exchange for listing and 
registration, and documents filed with the Commission pursuant to 
Section 33 of the Investment Company Act. The amendments would mandate 
the electronic submission in EDGAR of all of these documents to the 
Commission. In addition, certain foreign language documents currently 
are filed in paper format, but would be filed electronically under the 
amendments. There are several benefits to investors, filers, and the 
Commission of electronic submissions in EDGAR, relative to current 
submission methods.
    Electronic submissions on EDGAR will benefit the users of the 
information because the submissions, whether on the Commission's 
website or through third-party websites, are posted faster compared to 
non-EDGAR submissions. Thus, the public may be able to find and review 
a filing more quickly, as a result of the amendments, than they are 
able to access paper filings. In addition, the costs associated with 
obtaining documents filed electronically on EDGAR will likely be 
reduced for those investors who currently access paper documents via 
third-party entities.
    To the extent that these documents inform investors' decisions, 
this reduction in search costs may allow investors to incorporate more 
information or make quicker decisions.\78\ Further, the use of an 
online fillable form for Form 144 will benefit investors and other data 
users by standardizing the inputted data into a structured, machine-
readable custom XML format, making it easier to extract and process 
that data.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \78\ The format requirement for electronic filings on EDGAR 
under the amendments would be dictated by the EDGAR Filer Manual, 
which allows for HTML or ASCII submissions subject to certain 
exceptions. See EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) version 61 (Mar. 
2022), at 2.1 and 5.2. For select submissions, the EDGAR Filer 
Manual accepts PDF format. See EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) 
version 61 (Mar. 2022), at 5.2.3. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual 
will include foreign language documents and certifications that a 
security has been approved by an exchange for listing and 
registration among the list of PDF submissions. The benefits and 
costs discussed in this section with respect to electronic filings 
instead of the current paper or email submissions are those that we 
would expect to be realized from HTML, ASCII, or PDF submissions on 
EDGAR. These benefits and costs substantially arise to the same 
extent regardless of whether the filer uses the ASCII, HTML, or PDF 
format. All three formats are widely used, and none of them requires 
significant special expertise for their preparation, submission, or 
intake.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Electronic filings on EDGAR also increase the likelihood that the 
Commission receives documents promptly by limiting the possibility and 
risk of delay (e.g., a document getting lost in the mail). An increase 
in the certainty and timeliness of submissions ensures that the EDGAR 
system accurately reflects the status of submissions to the Commission.
    In addition, after initial transition costs, if any, filers are 
expected to broadly benefit from the amendments. Specifically, filers 
are expected to realize direct benefits in the form of reduced time 
required to file forms electronically on EDGAR, compared to a paper 
filing, and avoid copying and mailing expenses. For example, the use of 
a fillable Form 144 on EDGAR will enable the convenient input of 
information and support the electronic assembly of such information and 
transmission to EDGAR, without requiring a Form 144 filer to purchase 
or maintain additional software or technology, thus minimizing 
compliance costs. This modification of the data format language of Form 
144 would also benefit data users by standardizing the inputted data 
into a structured, machine-readable custom XML-based format data 
language specific to Form 144, thus making it easier to extract and 
process that data.
    Filers who make multiple submissions are likely to benefit the 
most. Electronic filing using EDGAR will make the filing process more 
efficient and less costly for filers because it will assure timely 
receipt of the filing (e.g., filers would have no reason to pay for 
premium services such as delivery confirmation).\79\ Furthermore, 
electronic submissions allow filers to produce and submit documents 
more easily during disruptive events--such as the COVID-19 pandemic--if 
their physical work facilities are inaccessible.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \79\ The amendments also benefit filers by avoiding uncertainty 
about how to comply with paper filing obligations in events similar 
to the current COVID-19 pandemic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Electronic submissions likewise increase efficiencies in record 
management and maintenance as well as compliance with the Commission's 
record keeping requirements as electronic submissions are easier to 
store, access, search, and track. A reduction in search costs related 
to electronic submissions may improve regulatory oversight.
    Overall, for the documents currently submitted primarily 
electronically on EDGAR, the amendments would likely only yield 
incremental benefits for investors, filers, and Commission staff and 
would likely result in small aggregate economic effects. The aggregate 
economic effects would likely be greater with respect to forms filed by 
Development Banks and Form 144, as fewer of those are currently filed 
on EDGAR.
b. ``Glossy'' Annual Reports to Security Holders
    The amendments also mandate that certain registrants electronically 
file their ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders. This could 
result in several benefits for investors, filers, and the Commission.

[[Page 35403]]

    First, the amendments would ensure that investors have long-term 
access to ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders in a 
centralized location. Current rules do not require the preservation of 
these reports in a centralized location. To the extent that registrants 
are currently posting these reports on their websites consistent with 
the 2016 Staff Guidance, these registrants could remove these reports 
from their firm websites after one year (e.g., at the registrant's 
discretion or due to registrant failures, mergers, etc.). If a 
registrant were to take its ``glossy'' annual report to security 
holders off its website, it could be difficult and/or costly to obtain 
a copy (e.g., via a third-party entity) or impossible if no third-party 
has a saved copy. Under the amendments, documents would be freely 
available and centrally located on EDGAR, and investors would incur 
only minimal search costs for these reports.
    A glossy annual report repository on EDGAR will also benefit 
investors who may want to review and analyze ``glossy'' annual reports 
to security holders in bulk. For these investors, a unified file format 
for ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders in a centralized 
location (i.e., EDGAR) would create opportunities for data processing 
relative to the baseline.
    Further, we expect that this amendment would yield benefits to 
filers similar to those discussed above with respect to electronic 
submissions on EDGAR. For example, some registrants will save on print 
and delivery costs. Such cost savings are likely small, but any such 
benefits may accrue to investors to the extent that these registrants 
allocate the savings to increase firm efficiency or return capital to 
investors. In addition, the amended rules will ensure that investors 
and Commission staff are able to access the ``glossy'' annual reports 
to security holders easily, including when navigating disruptive 
events, such as COVID-19, when physical offices may be inaccessible.
c. Inline XBRL Requirement for Form 11-K
    The amendments require filers to tag the financial statements and 
schedules required in annual reports for employee benefit plans 
pursuant to Form 11-K using the Inline XBRL structured data language. 
Currently, reports on Form 11-K that are filed electronically must be 
filed in HTML or ASCII.\80\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \80\ See Rules 101(b)(3) and 301 of Regulation S-T and the EDGAR 
Filer Manual (Volume II) version 61 (Mar. 2022), at 2.1 and 5.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Requiring Form 11-K disclosures to be submitted in Inline XBRL 
could benefit those participating in employee benefit plans by 
facilitating analysis of the plan's annual financial disclosures over 
time and relative to other plans.\81\ Investors in the plans' 
sponsoring companies may also benefit from structured Form 11-Ks, as 
structured data may reduce processing and search costs incurred by 
investors assessing the employee benefit plans' underlying assets and 
liabilities. In addition, requiring Form 11-K financial disclosures to 
be submitted in Inline XBRL could enable the development of additional 
structured data sets and tools to facilitate market analysis and better 
inform future policy decisions.\82\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \81\ Currently, operating company financial disclosures in 
certain periodic reports and registration statements are required to 
be structured in XBRL or Inline XBRL, depending on the filing date. 
Research analyzing XBRL and Inline XBRL disclosures have found 
informational benefits relative to unstructured disclosures. See, 
e.g., Steven F. Cahan, Seokjoo Chang, Wei Z. Siqueira, & Kinsun Tam, 
The roles of XBRL and processed XBRL in 10-K readability. 49 J. Bus. 
Fin. & Acct. 33 (2021); Nerissa C. Brown, Brian Gale, and Stephanie 
M. Grant, How Do Disclosure Repetition and Interactivity Influence 
Investors' Judgments? (working paper Dec. 15, 2021), available at 
<a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=3557891">https://ssrn.com/abstract=3557891</a> (retrieved from SSRN Elsevier 
database); Jacqueline L. Birt, Kala Muthusamy, and Poonam Bir, XBRL 
and the qualitative characteristics of useful financial information,

    \82\ The Commission currently makes XBRL datasets for operating 
company financial statements and footnotes and mutual fund risk/
return summaries available on its website. See DERA Data Library, 
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/dera/data">https://www.sec.gov/dera/data</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Costs
    Requiring electronic submissions may result in costs to filers, 
including those associated with filing a Form ID for the first time to 
obtain the access codes needed to submit an application on the 
Commission's EDGAR system.\83\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \83\ Filers can set up a Form ID by following the processes 
detailed in Volume I of the EDGAR Filer Manual. Once a Form ID has 
been successfully completed and processed, EDGAR establishes a 
Central Index Key (``CIK'') number, which permits each authorized 
user to create an EDGAR access code, enabling the filer to use 
EDGAR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to documents that are mostly submitted electronically 
on EDGAR under current rules (e.g., Form 6-K, Notices of Exempt 
Solicitation, Certifications of Approval of Exchange Listing), these 
costs will likely be minimal. For documents that are not generally 
submitted electronically on EDGAR under current rules but would be 
required to be electronically submitted on EDGAR under the amended 
rules (e.g., Form 144 and ``glossy'' annual reports to security 
holders), registrants would incur additional costs to upload such 
documents to EDGAR.\84\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \84\ For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), we 
estimate that the additional burden to submit an electronic copy of 
the ``glossy'' annual report would be 2 internal burden hours per 
year. See Section V, infra.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For Form 144, we estimate that approximately 25 percent of Form 144 
filers have already prepared a Form ID and obtained a CIK number 
through other EDGAR filing obligations.\85\ Therefore, we estimate that 
at most 75 percent of Form 144 filers would need to file a Form ID as a 
result of the amendments.\86\ We believe that such direct costs for 
these filers would be justified by the anticipated benefits from 
eliminating paper filing of Form 144. Given that current EDGAR filers 
represent such a small proportion of those who submit Form 144, our 
ability to generalize electronic filing behavior from this group to the 
full population of filers may be of limited reliability. To the extent 
that such filers' behavior may be similar, however, we estimate that up 
to one-third of affiliates submitting a Form 144 who do not currently 
access EDGAR may be able to use an issuer's existing connection to 
EDGAR or rely upon other support by issuers in meeting their Form 144 
electronic filing obligations. These filers likely will incur lower 
costs as a result of the amendments than filers who cannot or will not 
use an issuer's existing connection to EDGAR. We lack the data to 
quantify the difference in costs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \85\ Specifically, we observe that approximately 23 percent of 
calendar year 2019 Form 144 filers also submitted Form 4 filings in 
EDGAR, while a remaining two percent without Form 4 filings in EDGAR 
submitted a miscellany of other forms related to beneficial 
ownership.
    \86\ This estimate represents an extreme upper bound because it 
assumes that each named individual who filed at least one Form 144 
in calendar year 2019 who is not currently associated with a unique 
CIK would need to file a Form ID. To the extent that some Form 144 
filers are affiliates of issuers who may use the issuer's CIK to 
file via EDGAR, the estimate likely overstates the required number 
of new Form IDs required and the burden hours associated with such 
applications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We do not expect that the requirement to file Form 144 in a 
structured, XML-based data language specific to Form 144 (``custom 
XML,'' here ``Form 144-specific XML'') will impose any incremental 
compliance costs on Form 144 filers, as these filers will have the 
option of entering their disclosures directly into a fillable web form. 
The fillable web form will render into Form 144-specific XML in EDGAR, 
rather than filing directly in Form 144-specific XML using the 
technical specifications published on the Commission's website. We 
expect that completing this XML-based fillable form will not require 
any more time than completing the paper

[[Page 35404]]

form or filing an HTML or ASCII document (as is required for most other 
EDGAR forms).\87\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \87\ The Commission's EDGAR electronic filing system generally 
requires filers to use ASCII or HTML for their document submissions, 
subject to certain exceptions. See EDGAR Filer Manual (Volume II) 
version 61 (Mar. 2022), at 5.1; 17 CFR 232.301 (incorporating EDGAR 
Filer Manual into Regulation S-T). See also 17 CFR 232.101 (setting 
forth the obligation to file electronically on EDGAR).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One commenter \88\ indicated that entities filing Form 144 on 
behalf of many clients may experience an increase in costs as a result 
of the amendments. We believe such costs would be justified by the 
benefits of mandated electronic Form 144 filing, including the 
reduction in costs for investors and other market participants to 
retrieve these documents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \88\ See supra note 31.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, there are over 7,400 registrants who would be 
required to file their ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders 
electronically on EDGAR under the amendments. We expect that their 
costs will be mitigated since these registrants are already 
electronically filing documents on EDGAR, such as Form 10-K, 20-F, or 
40-F. For filers submitting documents electronically to EDGAR for the 
first time, any initial setup costs would likely be offset by lower 
ongoing, marginal costs over time.
    Requiring Inline XBRL structuring of annual financial statements 
and schedules required by Form 11-K will result in additional 
compliance costs for filers relative to the current baseline, as filers 
will be required to tag and review the required Form 11-K financial 
disclosures before filing them with the Commission.\89\ Various XBRL 
and Inline XBRL preparation solutions have been developed and used by 
operating companies and open-end fund filers to fulfill their existing 
structuring requirements. In addition, some evidence suggests that, for 
operating companies, XBRL compliance costs have decreased over 
time.\90\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \89\ An AICPA survey of 1,032 reporting companies with $75 
million or less in market capitalization in 2018 found an average 
cost of $5,850 per year, a median cost of $2,500 per year, and a 
maximum cost of $51,500 per year for fully outsourced XBRL creation 
and filing, representing a 45% decline in average cost and a 69% 
decline in median cost since 2014. See Michael Cohn, AICPA sees 45% 
drop in XBRL costs for small companies, Acct. Today, August 15, 
2018, available at <a href="https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/aicpa-sees-45-drop-in-xbrl-costs-for-small-reporting-companies">https://www.accountingtoday.com/news/aicpa-sees-45-drop-in-xbrl-costs-for-small-reporting-companies</a> (retrieved from 
Factiva database). A NASDAQ survey of 151 listed issuers in 2018 
found an average XBRL compliance cost of $20,000 per quarter, a 
median XBRL compliance cost of $7,500 per quarter, and a maximum 
XBRL compliance cost of $350,000 per quarter. See letter from 
Nasdaq, Inc. dated March 21, 2019 to the Request for Comment on 
Earnings Releases and Quarterly Reports, Release No. 33-10588 (Dec. 
18, 2018) [83 FR 65601]. For purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act 
(PRA), we estimate that the additional burden on 11-K filers to 
submit statements and schedules in Inline XBRL would be 
approximately 65 hours of internal time and $7,500 for outside 
professional costs per year. See Section V, infra.
    \90\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Further, while Form 11-Ks are filed by employee benefit plans, 
which are not currently subject to other Inline XBRL filing 
requirements, the plans' sponsoring companies (i.e., the employers) are 
subject to Inline XBRL requirements for publicly filed annual and 
interim financial statements, among other disclosures.\91\ To the 
extent that a plan shares compliance systems with the sponsoring 
company, the Inline XBRL compliance costs incurred may be somewhat 
mitigated.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \91\ See Rules 405 and 406 of Regulation S-T and Items 
601(b)(101) and 601(b)(104) of Regulation S-K.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The amendments could reduce revenue for market information 
aggregators who currently aggregate Form 144 information from non-
electronic fillings into databases and provide access to such databases 
to various users of this data for a fee. The reduction in revenue could 
be mitigated by the lower cost of retrieving information that is filed 
in an electronic format. Data aggregators could sell fewer 
subscriptions to make the same profit or lower the fee that they charge 
which might make their services continue to be attractive even with the 
electronic availability of the filings.
3. Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
    For forms largely already submitted on EDGAR, we expect the 
amendments to lead to minimal changes in costs and have only 
incremental benefits. Therefore, the mandatory electronic filing on 
EDGAR of these forms will likely only marginally affect efficiency, 
competition, or capital formation. For other documents, such as Form 
144, the amendments are expected to make the filing process more 
efficient by making it easier and less costly for filers to assure 
timely receipt of the filing.
    As previously noted, electronic filings on EDGAR will increase the 
timeliness or ease with which the public can access the documents. 
Insofar as investors incorporate these documents into their information 
sets, easier or quicker access could result in lower search costs or 
more efficient decision-making. To the extent that there is value-
relevant information in these filings, prices may become more 
efficient, which should help to facilitate capital formation (e.g., by 
enhancing valuation quality). These benefits are potentially magnified 
during disruptive events, such as COVID-19, which can make it difficult 
for registrants to make submissions in non-electronic form and thus 
impede timely access to information. Moreover, as electronic filings 
often lead to lower ongoing, marginal costs for filers, compared to, 
for example, paper filings, the filing process may become more 
efficient, especially over the medium and longer term.
    The amendments may, however, reduce some investors' or market 
information aggregators' competitive advantages. Particularly, market 
information aggregators whose present role includes converting paper 
filings of Form 144 to an electronic information source may find that 
this service is less attractive to data users due to those users' 
ability to access these filings directly due to the rule changes. These 
information aggregators' loss of competitive advantage in converting 
paper filings of Form 144 to an electronic information source may 
reduce their revenue and thus may affect their ability to offer other 
ancillary services that are valuable to data users.

D. Reasonable Alternatives

    In formulating the amendments, we considered requiring some, but 
not all, of the affected documents to be filed electronically on EDGAR. 
This alternative would reduce the benefits, compared to the amendments, 
but also would reduce the initial transition burden for filers that do 
not have other electronic disclosure obligations on EDGAR. As discussed 
above, however, many of the filers of affected documents already file 
these or other documents electronically on EDGAR. For Form 144, for 
which most of the current filings are not made on EDGAR, the benefits 
of electronic filing on EDGAR for both filers and investors, such as 
the speed of public dissemination, justify the costs. Further, any 
setup costs for first time filers are at least partially offset by 
lower marginal costs.
    Given the significant number of submissions via email in response 
to the temporary Form 144 staff no-action position, we could have made 
this manner of filing a permanent option for Form 144 filers. Such an 
alternative would allow filers to avoid the direct costs of 
transitioning to filing electronically using EDGAR. Such an 
alternative, however, would result in filers incurring expenses in 
scanning the forms and emailing them to the Commission. Additionally, 
filers would forgo potential direct benefits in the

[[Page 35405]]

form of reduced time required to file forms electronically. Such costs 
could be higher for filers who make multiple submissions per year and 
for filings with multiple pages.
    Data users might also incur higher costs under this alternative 
since the site used to access Form 144 email submissions, for example, 
is distinct from EDGAR. Specifically, under this alternative, a data 
user interested in obtaining the information from all Form 144 filings 
pertaining to a given filer would be required to search both EDGAR and 
the daily folders posted to the Form 144 website.\92\ Furthermore, Form 
144 data submitted via email submissions is not structured, therefore 
analysis that would require aggregating data from multiple submissions 
would be more difficult or most costly to perform.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \92\ Paper filings submitted via email based on the staff's no-
action position are available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email">https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/form-144-email</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As an alternative, we could have required Form 144 to be filed in 
Inline XBRL, which is designed for business reporting and is both 
machine-readable and human-readable. Compared to the amendments, the 
Inline XBRL alternative for Form 144 would have provided more 
sophisticated validation, presentation, and reference features for 
filers and data users. However, the Inline XBRL alternative would also 
have imposed initial implementation costs (e.g., learning how to 
prepare filings in Inline XBRL, licensing Inline XBRL filing 
preparation software) upon filers that do not have prior experience in 
structuring data in Inline XBRL. In contrast, because the amendments 
will allow filers to submit Form 144 using an online fillable form, 
filers that lack experience structuring data in a custom XML-based data 
language will not incur such implementation costs.
    We also considered permitting registrants to post their ``glossy'' 
annual reports to security holders on their websites in lieu of 
electronic submission consistent with the 2016 Staff Guidance. While 
this alternative might reduce costs for registrants who currently post 
``glossy'' annual reports to security holders on their websites, we do 
not anticipate that the costs of submitting these reports on EDGAR 
would be unduly burdensome for most filers. Further, this alternative 
would also reduce the benefits compared to the amendment, because it 
would not offer market participants access to ``glossy'' annual reports 
to security holders in a centralized location.

V. Paperwork Reduction Act

A. Background

    Certain provisions of our rules, schedules, and forms that will be 
affected by the amendments contain ``collection of information'' 
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 
(``PRA'').\93\ The Commission is submitting the final amendments to the 
Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') for review in accordance with 
the PRA.\94\ The titles for the collections of information are:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \93\ 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
    \94\ 44 U.S.C. 3507(d); 5 CFR 1320.11.

<bullet> Schedule 14A (OMB Control Number 3235-0059) \95\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \95\ As described below, our estimates for Schedule 14A and 
Schedule 14C take into account the burden that would be incurred 
under the amendments to require electronic submission of the 
``glossy'' annual report to security holders. Schedules 14A and 14C 
require disclosure under Subpart 400 of Regulation S-K. This 
disclosure is often incorporated, in relevant part, into Part III of 
a registrant's Form 10-K and is provided as part of the ``glossy'' 
annual report to security holders. Therefore, we have not separately 
calculated burden requirements for Form 10-K.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<bullet> Schedule 14C (OMB Control Number 3235-0057) \96\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \96\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<bullet> Form 20-F (OMB Control Number 3232-0288) \97\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \97\ Forms 20-F and 40-F provide the disclosure requirements for 
the annual reports of foreign private issuers, which are included in 
the ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders. Therefore, we 
have not separately calculated burden requirements for Form 6-K.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

<bullet> Form 40-F (OMB Control Number 3235-0381)
<bullet> Form 11-K (OMB Control Number 3235-0082)
<bullet> Form ID (OMB Control Number 3235-0328) \98\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \98\ The paperwork implications of the changes to mandate 
electronic filing of Form 144 would be reflected in Form ID.

    An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required 
to comply with, a collection of information unless it displays a 
currently valid OMB control number. Compliance with the information 
collections is mandatory. Responses to the information collections are 
not kept confidential and there is no mandatory retention period for 
the information disclosed. Schedule 14A, Schedule 14C, Form 20-F, Form 
40-F, and Form 11-K were adopted under the Securities Act and the 
Exchange Act. The schedules and forms set forth the disclosure 
requirements for periodic and current reports, proxy statements, and 
information statements filed to help investors make informed investment 
and voting decisions. Form ID, adopted under the Securities Act, the 
Exchange Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,\99\ and the Investment 
Company Act of 1940,\100\ is used by registrants, individuals, third 
party filers or their agents to request access codes that permit the 
filing of documents on EDGAR in accordance with Rule 10 of Regulation 
S-T.\101\ The hours and costs associated with preparing, filing, and 
sending the schedules and forms constitute reporting and cost burdens 
imposed by each collection of information.

    A description of the final amendments, including the need for the 
information and its intended use, as well as a description of the 
likely respondents, can be found in Section II above. A discussion of 
the economic effects of the amendments can be found in Section IV 
above.

B. Summary of the Comment Letters and the Effect of the Final 
Amendments on Existing Collections of Information

    As described in more detail above, we are adopting final amendments 
to update filing requirements under our EDGAR system. The amendments 
would (1) mandate the electronic filing or submission of the documents 
that are currently permitted electronic submissions under Regulation S-
T; \102\ (2) mandate the electronic submission of the ``glossy'' annual 
report to security holders; (3) mandate the electronic filing of the 
certification made pursuant to the Exchange Act and its rules that a 
security has been approved by an exchange for listing and registration; 
(4) mandate the use of Inline XBRL for the filing of the financial 
statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements required 
by Form 11-K; and (5) provide for the electronic submission of certain 
foreign language documents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \102\ See supra Section II.A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The amendments do not change the nature or extent of any of the 
information that is currently collected under Rule 101(b), the foreign 
language documents submitted under Rule 306 of Regulation S-T, or the 
certifications filed under Exchange Act Rule 12d1-3. However, as 
discussed below, we expect that the change to require an electronic 
format will result in certain changes in the information collection 
burden of associated forms, schedules, reports, and applications. We 
did not receive any comment letters regarding our PRA estimates related 
to these amendments from either the Updating EDGAR Proposing Release or 
the Rule 144 Proposing Release.

[[Page 35406]]

C. Burden and Cost Estimates Related to the Amendments

    Below we estimate the incremental change in internal burden and 
outside professional cost as a result of the amendments. These 
estimates represent the average burden for all registrants, both large 
and small. In deriving our estimates, we recognize that the burdens 
will likely vary among individual registrants based on a number of 
factors, including the nature of their business. Except for Form ID, we 
do not believe that the amendments will change the frequency of 
responses to the existing collections of information; rather, we 
estimate that the amendments will change only the burden per response.
    The burden estimates were calculated by multiplying the estimated 
number of responses by the estimated average amount of time it would 
take a registrant to prepare and review the disclosures required under 
the amendments. For purposes of the PRA, the burden is allocated 
between internal burden hours and outside professional costs. The table 
below sets forth the percentage estimates the Commission typically uses 
for the burden allocation for each form. We also estimate that the 
average cost of retaining an outside professional is $400 per 
hour.\103\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \103\ We recognize that the costs of retaining outside 
professionals may vary depending on the nature of the professional 
services, but for purposes of this PRA analysis, we estimate that 
such costs would be an average of $400 per hour. This estimate is 
based on consultations with several registrants, law firms, and 
other entities that regularly assist registrants in preparing and 
filing documents with the Commission.
    \104\ While the current standard burden for Form 11-K is 100% 
internal, as noted below, in light of the nature of these 
amendments, we estimate that the Form 11-K burden of the amendments 
will be allocated 75% to internal hours and 25% to outside 
professional costs.

    With respect to the electronic submission of the ``glossy'' annual 
report to security holders, we estimate the amendments will impose a 
new burden that will be borne by all registrants required to submit 
``glossy'' annual reports to security holders to the Commission. We 
estimate that the amendments will cause a registrant to incur an 
increase of 2 hours in the reporting burden for the annual report to 
security holders. We anticipate that this time would be required to 
prepare, convert into the required electronic format (currently PDF) if 
PDF is not already used for the report to security holders, and review 
the ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders to be submitted 
electronically in accordance with the EDGAR Filer Manual. This burden 
would be reflected in Schedules 14A and 14C and Forms 20-F and 40-F as 
follows:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    With respect to the amendment to require the submission of the 
financial statements in the Form 11-K in Inline XBRL, we do not expect 
a change in the number of Forms 11-K submitted to the Commission but we 
do expect an increase in the burden per form. The Commission previously 
estimated that, per response, operating companies submitting financial 
information in Inline XBRL required 54 burden hours of internal time to 
prepare the tagged data and incurred a cost $6,175 for outside 
services.\105\ The amendments would subject employee purchase plans, 
savings plans, and similar plans to the same Inline XBRL reporting 
requirements. Therefore, we assume that these plans would experience 
similar burden hours and costs as do operating companies. We have 
however increased that burden estimate to account for the particular 
circumstances applicable to Form 11-K filers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \105\ See Inline XBRL Adopting Release, supra note 52.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As new XBRL filers, we anticipate that Form 11-K filers would 
experience additional burdens related to the one-time costs associated 
with becoming familiar with Inline XBRL reporting. These costs would 
include, for example, the acquisition of new software or the services 
of consultants, and/or the training of staff.\106\ We also assume that

[[Page 35407]]

these one-time costs would decline in the second and third year of 
compliance with the amendments, as Form 11-K filers become more 
efficient at preparing submissions using Inline XBRL.\107\ We assume 
that the one-time cost would result in a 50% incremental increase in 
the internal burdens and external costs of structuring the data in the 
financial statements and accompanying footnotes of the financial 
statements to Form 11-K.\108\ These additional incremental costs would 
decline in the second and third years by 75% from the immediately 
preceding year.\109\ Accordingly, we estimate that the amendment to 
require Form 11-K filers to submit the financial information in Inline 
XBRL would, for each filer, result in incremental PRA burdens of 11.81 
hours of internal time and $1,350.78 in costs for outside professional 
services, in addition to the 54 hours and $6,175 in costs noted above. 
In aggregate, we estimate these burdens to be 70,153 \110\ and 
$8,021,650,\111\ respectively.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \106\ Until now, the burden associated with the preparation of 
Form 11-K has been borne entirely by filers. In other words, 
registrants have not needed to retain outside professional services 
to prepare the submission. With the Inline XBRL tagging requirements 
under the amendments, we anticipate that registrants may retain 
outside professional services in order to tag the financial 
statements and accompanying notes to the financial statements 
properly. Accordingly, we are estimating increases for both burden 
hours and outside professional costs.
    \107\ We also expect filers to benefit from access to an 
established vendor community experienced in applying Inline XBRL 
tagging to Commission filings.
    \108\ We estimate, for the Form 11-K financial information 
Inline XBRL requirement, that in the first year the one-time cost 
would be an additional 27 hours (54 x 0.5) and $3,087.5 in external 
costs ($6,175 x 0.5).
    \109\ We estimate that for the second year the additional one-
time hour burden and cost of the Form 11-K financial information 
XBRL requirement would be 6.75 hours (27 hours-(27 x 0.75 = 20.25 
hours)) and $771.87 ($3,087.5-($3,087.5 x 0.75 = $2,315.63)). For 
the third year, we estimate that these hour burdens and costs would 
be 1.69 hours (6.75 hours-(6.75 x 0.75 = 5.06 hours)) and $192.97 
($771.87-($771.87 x 0.75 = $578.90)). Thus the three year average of 
the additional incremental burden of the Form 11-K financial 
information XBRL requirement would be (27 + 6.75 + 1.69)/3 = 11.81 
hours of internal in-house time, and ($3,087.5 + $771.87 + $192.97)/
3 = $1,350.78 in external costs.
    \110\ This estimate was calculated by adding the estimated XBRL 
hour burden for operating companies (54 hrs) plus the average 
additional incremental hour burden for Form 11-K filers (11.81), 
then multiplying the sum by the estimated number of Form 11-K filers 
(1,066), or (54 + 11.81) x 1,066 = 70,153.
    \111\ This estimate was calculated by adding the estimated XBRL 
cost burden for operating companies ($6,175) plus the average 
additional incremental cost burden for Form 11-K filers ($1,350), 
then multiplying the sum by the estimated number of Form 11-K filers 
(1,066), or ($6,175 + $1,350) x 1,066 = $8,021,650.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We anticipate that the mandated electronic filing of Form 144 with 
respect to securities issued by issuers subject to Exchange Act 
reporting requirements will result in a number of filers using EDGAR to 
file their Form 144 electronically who do not currently do so. Filers 
who have not previously filed electronically on EDGAR must apply for 
access to file on EDGAR on Form ID. As the majority of Form 144 filings 
currently are paper or email filings, most filers would have to modify 
their processes for submitting their Form 144 filings. Based on past 
filings, we estimate that approximately 12,250 filers will be required 
to switch from paper filings to electronic filing of their Form 
144.\112\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \112\ These estimates assume that filers of Form 144 submissions 
in our data are not also affiliates of other issuers. Because we 
lack data on the holdings of filers in securities of issuers other 
than those disclosed in the Form 144, we are unable to identify any 
filers that are such affiliates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Of those 12,250 filers, however, we estimate that 25 percent have 
already filed a Form ID through other EDGAR filing obligations.\113\ A 
filer must apply for access to file on EDGAR on Form ID. Accordingly, 
approximately 75 percent of Form 144 filers (9,188 filers \114\) would 
need to file a Form ID for the first time as a result of the amendment 
to mandate the electronic filing of Form 144. In addition, there are 
currently two Development Banks that have not previously made an 
electronic filing on EDGAR that would also be required as a result of 
the amendments to file a Form ID to obtain the access codes that are 
required to file or submit a document on EDGAR.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \113\ Specifically, we observe that approximately 23 percent of 
calendar year 2019 Form 144 filers also submitted Form 4 filings in 
EDGAR, while a remaining two percent without Form 4 filings in EDGAR 
submitted a miscellany of other forms in EDGAR related to beneficial 
ownership.
    \114\ 12,250 x 0.75 = 9,187.5. This estimate represents an 
extreme upper bound because it assumes that each named individual 
who filed at least one Form 144 in calendar year 2019 who is not 
currently associated with a unique CIK would need to file a Form ID. 
To the extent that some Form 144 filers are affiliates of issuers 
who may use the issuer's CIK to file via EDGAR, the estimate likely 
overstates the required number of new Form IDs required and the 
burden hours associated with such applications.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We estimate that respondents require 0.15 hours to complete the 
Form ID and, for purposes of the PRA, that 100 percent of the burden of 
preparation for Form ID is carried by the respondent internally. 
Therefore, we estimate that this amendment will result in an 
incremental increase of 1,378.50 annual burden hours for Form ID.\115\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \115\ 9,190 x 0.15 = 1,378.5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The tables below illustrate the estimated incremental change to the 
total annual compliance burden of the affected forms, in hours and in 
costs, as a result of the amendments.

VI. Final Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis

    The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA'') \116\ requires the 
Commission, in promulgating rules under Section 553 of the 
Administrative Procedure Act,\117\ to consider the impact of those 
rules on small entities. We have prepared this Final Regulatory 
Flexibility Act Analysis (``FRFA'') in accordance with Section 604 of 
the RFA.\118\ An initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (``IRFA'') was 
prepared in accordance with the RFA and was included in the Proposing 
Release. This FRFA relates to the amendments to the rules and forms 
described in Section II above.

[[Page 35408]]

A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Final Amendments

    The main purpose of the amendments is to facilitate more efficient 
transmission, dissemination, analysis, storage and retrieval of 
documents that are currently filed in paper. In addition, the 
amendments are intended to improve investors' and other EDGAR users' 
access to the information in these documents.
    The need for, and objectives of, the amendments are discussed in 
more detail in Section II above. We discuss the economic impact, 
including the estimated compliance costs and burdens, of the amendments 
in Sections IV and V above.

B. Small Entities Subject to the Final Amendments

    The final amendments will affect some registrants that are small 
entities. The Regulatory Flexibility Act defines ``small entity'' to 
mean ``small business,'' ``small organization,'' or ``small 
governmental jurisdiction.'' \119\ For purposes of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act, under our rules, a registrant, other than an 
investment company, is a ``small business'' or ``small organization'' 
if it had total assets of $5 million or less on the last day of its 
most recent fiscal year and is engaged or proposing to engage in an 
offering of securities that does not exceed $5 million.\120\ An 
investment company, including a business development company,\121\ is 
considered to be a ``small business'' if it, together with other 
investment companies in the same group of related investment companies, 
has net assets of $50 million or less as of the end of its most recent 
fiscal year.\122\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \119\ 5 U.S.C. 601(6).
    \120\ See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).
    \121\ Business development companies are a category of closed-
end investment company that are not registered under the Investment 
Company Act [15 U.S.C. 80a-2(a)(48) and 80a-53-64].
    \122\ See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We estimate that there are 979 issuers that file with the 
Commission, other than investment companies, that may be considered 
small entities.\123\ In addition, we estimate that, as of April, 2022, 
there are approximately 80 investment companies, including 12 business 
development companies, which would be subject to the proposed 
amendments that may be considered small entities.\124\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \123\ This estimate is based on staff analysis of issuers, 
excluding co-registrants, subsidiaries, or asset-backed issuers, 
with EDGAR filings of Forms 10-K, 20-F, and 40-F, or amendments to 
these forms, filed during the calendar year of January 1, 2020, to 
December 31, 2020 or filed by September 1, 2020 that, if timely 
filed by the applicable deadline, would have been filed between 
January 1 and December 31, 2021. Analysis is based on data from XBRL 
filings, Compustat, and Ives Group Audit Analytics and manual review 
of filings submitted to the Commission.
    \124\ See 15 U.S.C. 80a et seq. The estimate is based upon staff 
analysis of issuers as of December 2021 that have aggregate net 
assets under $50 million and whose adviser/sponsor is not affiliated 
with a larger organization (as defined by Rule 0-10 of the 
Investment Company Act). It includes registrants that are delinquent 
or have begun the deregistration process and may include new funds 
that have not filed their first statement with financials.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

    In the Proposing Release, we requested comment on all aspects of 
the IRFA, including the number of small entities that would be affected 
by the Proposed Rules, the existence or nature of the potential impact 
of the proposals on small entities discussed in the analysis, and how 
to quantify the impact of the Proposed Rules. We did not receive any 
comments specifically addressing the IRFA. We received a number of 
comments on other aspects of the Proposed Rules \125\ and considered 
those comments in developing the FRFA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \125\ See supra Section II.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements

    As noted in Section IV.C., the amendments will not substantively 
affect the filings currently made under Rules 101(b)(2), (5), (6), or 
(9) or the foreign language documents submitted under Rule 306. 
Therefore, the reporting or compliance burdens associated with 
associated forms, schedules, reports, and applications for small 
entities will remain unchanged under these amendments.
    The amendments will however impose new submission obligations on 
certain registrants. In particular, the amendments mandate the 
electronic submission of the ``glossy'' annual report to security 
holders and the electronic submission in Inline XBRL format of the 
financial statements and accompanying notes required by Form 11-K. In 
addition, to the extent that a filer has not previously filed documents 
on EDGAR electronically, registrants who previously filed or submitted 
in paper format under Rule 101(b) would need to apply for access to 
file on EDGAR on Form ID.
    Additionally, the amendments would mandate electronic filing of 
Form 144 with respect to securities issued by companies subject to 
Exchange Act reporting requirements. We anticipate that this amendment 
would cause a number of filers, including small entities, using EDGAR 
to file their Form 144 electronically who do not currently do so, 
thereby modestly increasing their compliance obligations.
    Section II discusses the amendments in detail. Sections IV and V 
discuss the economic impact, including the estimated costs and 
benefits, of the amendments to all affected entities. Compliance with 
certain provisions of the amendments may require the use of 
professional skills, including legal and technical skills.

E. Agency Action To Minimize Effect on Small Entities

    The RFA directs us to consider alternatives that would accomplish 
our stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse effect 
on small entities. Accordingly, we considered the following 
alternatives:
    <bullet> Establishing different compliance or reporting 
requirements or timetables that take into account the resources 
available to small entities;
    <bullet> Clarifying, consolidating or simplifying compliance and 
reporting requirements for small entities under our rules as revised by 
the amendments;
    <bullet> Using performance rather than design standards; and
    <bullet> Exempting small entities from coverage of all or part of 
the amendments.
    Partially or completely exempting small entities from the 
electronic filing requirements would undermine our stated objective of 
facilitating more efficient transmission, dissemination, analysis, 
storage and retrieval of documents that are currently filed in paper, 
and we expect any increased burden associated with most of the proposed 
amendments to be small. With respect to the amendments to mandate the 
electronic submission of ``glossy'' annual reports to security holders 
and the proposed amendments to mandate the use of Inline XBRL for the 
filing of financial statements and accompanying notes to the financial 
statements required by Form 11-K, we are providing six-month and three-
year transition periods, respectively, for all registrants, including 
small entities.
    We believe these transition periods will provide adequate time for 
all filers to prepare for and manage the burdens associated with these 
new obligations. Moreover, to the extent that the amendments increase 
the ease and efficiency with which certain documents can be submitted 
to the Commission, they should benefit all filers, including small 
entities. In this regard, it appears that few filers currently take 
advantage of paper filing options under our current rules. For these 
reasons, we do not believe that it

[[Page 35409]]

is necessary to establish different compliance timetables or reporting 
requirements for small entities or to clarify, consolidate or simplify 
the requirements.
    The amendments use design rather than performance standards in 
order to promote uniform filing requirements for all registrants.

VII. Statutory Authority

    The amendments contained in this document are being adopted under 
the authority set forth in Sections 6, 7, 8, 10 and 19(a) of the 
Securities Act, Sections 3, 12, 13, 14, 15(d), 16, 23(a) and 35A of the 
Exchange Act, and Sections 10 and 38 of the Investment Company Act.
