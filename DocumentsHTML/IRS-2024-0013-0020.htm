a request from the Secretary of Commerce. These regulations require no 
action by taxpayers and have no effect on their tax liabilities.

DATES: 
    Effective date: These final regulations are effective on November 
26, 2024.
    Applicability date: For the date of applicability, see Sec.  
301.6103(j)(1)-1.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Authority

    This document amends the Procedure and Administration Regulations, 
26 CFR part 301, relating to section 6103(j)(1)(A) of the Internal 
Revenue Code (Code), by adding final regulations under section 6103 
(final regulations). Section 6103(j)(1) provides an express delegation 
of authority to the Secretary of the Treasury or her delegate 
(Secretary), stating that, ``[u]pon request in writing by the Secretary 
of Commerce, the Secretary shall furnish . . . such returns, or return 
information reflected thereon, to officers and employees of the Bureau 
of the Census'' and ``such return information reflected on returns of 
corporations to officers and employees of the Bureau of Economic 
Analysis'' ``as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation for the 
purpose of, but only to the extent necessary in, the structuring of 
censuses and national economic accounts and conducting related 
statistical activities authorized by law.'' Section 6103(q) further 
authorizes the Secretary to ``prescribe such other regulations as are 
necessary to carry out the provisions of'' section 6103. The final 
regulations are also issued under the express delegation of authority 
under section 7805(a) of the Code.

Background

    There is a long history of providing return information to the 
Bureau under section 6103(j)(1)(A), and the regulations promulgated 
under this section have been amended periodically to increase the 
amount of return information provided to facilitate the statistical 
activities of the Bureau. See e.g., TD 9037, 68 FR 2693, January 21, 
2003; TD 9188, 70 FR 12141, March 11, 2005; TD 9267, 71 FR 38263, July 
6, 2006; TD 9372, 72 FR 73262, December 27, 2007; TD 9439, 73 FR 79361, 
December 29, 2008; TD 9500, 75 FR 52459, August 26, 2010; TD 9631, 78 
FR 52857, August 27, 2013; TD 9754, 81 FR 9767, February 26, 2016; TD 
9856, 84 FR 14011, April 9, 2019.
    The existing regulations under section 6103(j)(1)(A) are set forth 
in 26 CFR 301.6103(j)(1)-1. They authorize the Bureau to receive return 
information that supports many different Bureau projects and programs, 
including the Economic Census, the Longitudinal Employer-Household 
Dynamics program, and the Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates 
program, among others.
    Pursuant to section 6103(p)(4), the IRS sets stringent privacy and 
security requirements for agencies receiving return information, 
including the Bureau. These requirements are currently detailed in IRS 
Publication 1075, Tax Information Security Guidelines For Federal, 
State and Local Agencies. See also Sec.  301.6103(p)(4)-1.
    By letter dated February 29, 2024, the Secretary of Commerce 
requested the Secretary amend existing Sec.  301.6103(j)(1)-1 to 
provide for the disclosure of additional items of return information to 
the Bureau to enable the Bureau to perform mission critical statistical 
functions. The Secretary of Commerce further stated that the additional 
items would allow the Bureau to conduct its economic, demographic, 
decennial, and research statistics programs, censuses, and related 
program evaluations. The amendments to the existing regulations would 
permit the Bureau to publish statistical information, enhance the use 
of administrative records, improve the quality of program estimates, 
and support the reduction of burden. The Secretary of Commerce's letter 
lists the additional items of return information requested based on the 
Bureau's specific need for each item of information.
    On March 29, 2024, a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-123376-22) 
was published in the Federal Register (89 FR 22101) (proposed 
regulations). The proposed regulations proposed amending the 
regulations that authorize disclosure of specified return information 
to the Bureau. The proposed regulations would allow the disclosure of 
additional items of return information requested by the Secretary of 
Commerce to enable the Bureau to perform mission critical statistical 
functions. The proposed regulations would also permit the disclosure of 
return information if an item of return information currently listed in 
the regulations is subsequently reported in a substantially similar 
format or on a substantially similar document.
    The proposed regulations would formalize existing practice to 
include (1) the requirement that all projects that use return 
information disclosed under these regulations be approved by the IRS 
Director of Statistics of Income, and (2) language related to the IRS's 
and the Bureau's disclosure review obligations.

Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions

    The Department of the Treasury (Treasury Department) and the IRS 
received eighteen comments in response to the proposed regulations. The 
comments are available for public inspection at <a href="https://www.regulations.gov">https://www.regulations.gov</a> or upon request. There was no request for a public 
hearing, and none was held. After full consideration of the comments 
received, which are described in this Summary of Comments and 
Explanation of Revisions, these final regulations adopt the proposed 
regulations with minor changes.

A. Comments Supporting the Proposed Regulations

    Nine of the comments received did not seek to modify the items of 
return information permitted to be disclosed to the Bureau pursuant to 
the proposed regulations. Of these comments, six were supportive of the 
proposed regulations. One comment noted the importance of 
administrative tax data in measuring and understanding income and 
wealth in the United States. Another comment noted that the proposed 
regulations would improve the Bureau's ability to accurately estimate 
household income and otherwise evaluate and improve the

[[Page 93173]]

Bureau's statistical products. This same comment also encouraged the 
IRS and the Bureau, along with the Office of Management and Budget and 
other statistical agencies, to explore additional pathways for 
increasing the statistical agencies' access to Federal tax data, as 
well as a greater sharing of administrative data across statistical 
agencies, noting that increased use of administrative data has 
significant promise for improving statistics on U.S. households and 
businesses. Finally, this comment noted its support for further 
consideration of possible means of expanding access to tax data for 
appropriate purposes in a reliably secure and confidential way.
    Another comment supported the proposed regulations and stated that 
the data that could be disclosed as outlined in the proposed 
regulations was crucial for the IRS's efforts to advance equity. As one 
example, this comment noted that, if finalized, the proposed 
regulations would provide an important opportunity for government and 
independent researchers to understand demographic trends regarding the 
Child Tax Credit (CTC) and other refundable credits, as well as to 
identify and track potential disparities in tax administration. Another 
comment noted that the proposed changes to the existing regulations 
would enable the Bureau to produce data that provides more detail about 
the economic conditions of various populations across the United 
States, including populations that have been historically underserved, 
marginalized, and adversely affected by health inequity.
    These comments reflect support for the proposed regulations' items 
of return information permitted to be disclosed to the Bureau. The 
Treasury Department and IRS agree that disclosure of this information 
will further the needs of the Bureau by authorizing the Bureau to 
receive return information that supports many different Bureau projects 
and programs, including the Economic Census, the Longitudinal Employer-
Household Dynamics program, and the Small Area Income and Poverty 
Estimates program, among others.

B. Comments Proposing That Additional Items of Return Information Be 
Disclosed to the Bureau

    Two comments suggested that additional information on the variety 
of energy credits under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) be 
furnished to the Bureau. The IRA, Public Law 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818 
(August 16, 2022), featured a significant number of new tax provisions 
related to clean energy. Section 6103(j)(1)(A) provides that the 
Secretary ``shall furnish'' returns or return information requested by 
the Secretary of Commerce ``for the purpose of, but only to the extent 
necessary in, the structuring of the censuses and national economic 
accounts and conducting related statistical activities authorized by 
law.'' In her request to the Secretary, the Secretary of Commerce did 
not request the furnishing of the return information recommended by the 
comments. Because the Secretary of Commerce did not request that 
information, the final regulations do not adopt these comments.
    Similarly, two other comments recommended that additional data 
regarding partnership returns be furnished to the Bureau--specifically, 
the zip code of partners included on Form 1065, U.S. Return of 
Partnership Income, Schedule K-1. The Secretary of Commerce in her 
request to the Secretary did not request the return information 
recommended by the comments. Accordingly, the final regulations do not 
adopt these comments.
    One comment suggested that it is important for the Bureau to have 
access to the series of Forms 1099 for both filers and non-filers 
because such information is important for measuring and understanding 
income and its distribution, and that the accuracy of income estimates 
would improve. The comment in particular identified Forms 1099-INT, 
Interest Income, and 1099-DIV, Dividends and Distributions, along with 
certain data from Form 1098-T, Tuition Statement (identifiers of the 
college attended, and tuition amount). The Secretary of Commerce in her 
request to the Secretary did not request the disclosure of the Form 
1099 series in general or the Forms 1099-INT or 1099-DIV specifically. 
The proposed regulations would permit the disclosure of payments 
received for qualified tuition and related expenses as well as the 
identity of the eligible educational institution filing Form 1098-T. 
Accordingly, no change to the final regulations is necessary to adopt 
these comments.
    Two other comments requested that payer and payee taxpayer 
identification numbers (TINs) from information returns be disclosed to 
the Bureau. Payer and payee TINs may already be disclosed to the Bureau 
under the existing regulations. See Sec. Sec.  301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1) 
(relating to individual taxpayers); 301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(2)(i) (relating 
to taxpayers engaged in a trade or business); 301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(3) 
(relating to business-related return information); and 301.6103(j)(1)-
1(b)(4) (relating to tax-exempt organizations). The proposed 
regulations similarly provide for the ability to disclose payer and 
payee TINs. See proposed Sec. Sec.  301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(i)(A) 
(relating to individual taxpayers); 301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(ii) 
(relating to returns filed on behalf of a trade or business); 
301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(iii) (relating to tax-exempt organizations). 
Accordingly, no change to the final regulations is necessary to adopt 
these comments.
    A comment supported the language in the proposed regulations that 
would provide the Bureau with information on health coverage (such as 
marketplace coverage parameters, and employer coverage on Forms 1095-A, 
Health Insurance Marketplace Statement, 1095-B, Health Coverage, and 
1095-C, Employer-Provided Health Insurance Offer and Coverage) noting 
that the information reported on these forms provides a comprehensive 
record of health coverage nationwide and fills important gaps in data. 
The comment also noted that information regarding health savings 
accounts (HSAs) from Form 5498-SA, HSA, Archer MSA, or Medicare 
Advantage MSA Information, would also be valuable to policymakers, as 
the policy considerations with respect to HSAs are a frequent and 
important focus of ongoing research. The Treasury Department and the 
IRS note that certain data from Form 5498-SA are already included in 
the information that would be permitted to be disclosed to the Bureau 
under the proposed regulations. The final regulations in this regard 
adopt the proposed regulations without modification.
    This same comment requested that the Bureau release (a) enhanced 
Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) of the Current Population 
Survey (CPS) data with new IRS data matched to it, and (b) detailed 
cross tabulations of newly released tax data by income, geographic 
area, filing type, and other available tax return statistics. In 
addition, this comment also encouraged the IRS to continue to carefully 
evaluate technical and policy solutions for safely sharing the various 
blended data and implement data governance principles such as 
accessibility and transparency, through the blending of IRS and Bureau 
data.
    This same comment suggested that various data elements should be 
disclosed to the Bureau to allow the Bureau to have a more accurate 
understanding of the impact of current tax benefits and the potential 
impact of modifications to these provisions. The

[[Page 93174]]

suggested data elements included: tax-filing status, income from 
various sources, the number of earned income tax credit (EITC) eligible 
qualifying children, the amount of tax credits like EITC and the CTC 
that families receive, and tax liabilities. Each of these data elements 
may be disclosed either directly or indirectly under the existing 
regulations and also under the proposed regulations. See proposed 
Sec. Sec.  301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(i) (reflecting returns and return 
information related to individual taxpayers); 301.6103(j)(1)-
1(b)(1)(i)(B) (regarding tax-filing status); 301.6103(j)(1)-
1(b)(1)(i)(O) (regarding earned income as defined under section 
32(c)(2)); 301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(i)(GG) (regarding the EITC); 
301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(i)(P) (regarding EITC-eligible qualifying 
children); 301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(i)(PP) (regarding the CTC). The 
overall tax liability of an individual taxpayer, which the Treasury 
Department and IRS interpret to mean the total amount of tax due or 
paid by an individual taxpayer, may be ascertained through the items of 
income, gain, deduction, and credit, that may similarly be disclosed 
under the proposed and final regulations. Accordingly, the final 
regulations adopt the proposed regulations in this respect without 
modification.

C. Comments Expressing Concerns Regarding Data Security

    One comment suggested that in its finalized form, the proposed 
regulations should state affirmatively that, in addition to IRS data 
privacy protections, data are and will remain confidential under 13 
U.S.C. 9, whether in their original form or when comingled or linked.
    The final regulations do not adopt this recommendation. The 
provision cited in the comment, 13 U.S.C. 9, governs the protection and 
use of confidential data by the Department of Commerce. Section 214 of 
title 13, United States Code governs criminal penalties against 
employees or staff members of the Bureau for prohibited disclosure of 
such confidential data. The disclosures that would be permitted by the 
proposed regulations concern disclosures made by the IRS under section 
6103(j) of Title 26, United States Code (Title 26). The proposed 
regulations, as well as these final regulations, do not govern data 
privacy or confidentiality requirements outside of Title 26. The 
Secretary of Commerce affirmed the application of 13 U.S.C. 9 and 214 
in her February 29, 2024, request to the Secretary.
    Two other comments expressed concerns that the data sharing 
contemplated by the proposed regulations would weaken the 
confidentiality of personal tax data held by the IRS, encourage the 
inappropriate release of personal tax information, and increase the 
vulnerability of individual tax return information to data breaches, 
intrusion, data theft, and abuse.
    The Treasury Department and the IRS take taxpayer confidentiality 
seriously. Section 6103(a) prohibits the unauthorized disclosure of tax 
returns and return information by officers or employees of the United 
States, which includes officers or employees of the Treasury 
Department, the IRS, the Department of Commerce, and the Bureau. 
Unauthorized disclosure of returns and return information, if willful, 
is a felony. See section 7213 of the Code. Unauthorized disclosure may 
also be punishable through civil damages. See section 7431 of the Code. 
Pursuant to section 6103(p)(4), the IRS sets stringent privacy and 
security requirements for agencies receiving return information, 
including the Bureau. See Sec.  301.6103(p)(4)-1. Proposed Sec.  
301.6103(j)(1)-1(d) did not propose to modify the requirements set 
forth in section 6103(p)(4) and, instead, noted their applicability, 
stating that if the IRS determines that the Bureau fails to satisfy 
those requirements, the IRS may take action to ensure that the 
requirements are satisfied, ``including suspension of disclosures of 
return information'' until the IRS determines that the requirements of 
section 6103(p)(4) have been, or will be, satisfied.
    No comments were received regarding proposed Sec.  301.6103(j)(1)-
1(d), and accordingly, the final regulations adopt the proposed 
regulation in this respect without modification. The regulation ensures 
that disclosures of returns and return information are made consistent 
with the requirements set forth in the Code and regulations, and that 
the IRS may suspend any disclosures to the Bureau should either entity 
fail to satisfy the requirements under section 6103(p)(4).

D. Comments Expressing Concerns About the Impacts of the Use of Data 
for Certain Classes of Taxpayers

    One comment requesting that the proposed regulations be withdrawn 
expressed concerns that sharing additional tax data with the Bureau 
would result in unintended adverse consequences for immigrant 
communities. Specifically, the comment noted that additional data 
sharing could result in a ``chilling effect'' for immigrant taxpayers, 
suggesting that individuals may not file tax returns because they are 
concerned that their tax return data will be shared with immigration 
enforcement agencies. The comment also expressed a concern that the 
proposed regulations could result in the creation of a list of 
taxpayers who file returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification 
Numbers that could be used to target individuals presumed to be 
undocumented for immigration enforcement purposes. The comment noted 
that the IRS should continue to assure taxpayers that their data is 
secure and that they can safely file their taxes without being 
concerned that their information will be used for reasons beyond tax 
administration.
    As discussed previously in this Summary of Comments and Explanation 
of Revisions, return information that a taxpayer provides to the IRS 
may not be disclosed unless otherwise permitted by Title 26, and 
unauthorized disclosures of returns or return information may be 
subject to criminal and civil penalties. There is no provision in the 
United States Code that authorizes the disclosure or redisclosure of 
returns or return information for enforcement of immigration laws. 
Comments regarding other possible lawful disclosures of taxpayer 
information are outside the scope of these regulations because the 
proposed regulations relate to the disclosure of specified return 
information to the Bureau, as permitted by law, and not to any other 
agency, such as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement or the U.S. 
Department of Homeland Security.
    Another comment requested that the proposed regulations be 
withdrawn because sharing such personal and entity tax data encourages 
a racial and/or gender diversity impact analysis of tax policy 
decisions. The comment further stated that such a racial or gender 
diversity impact analysis is inappropriate where no discriminatory 
intent has been demonstrated and where tax provisions have been 
introduced by Congress based on independent considerations of tax 
policy without any design or purpose to create disproportionate racial 
or gender impact. The Treasury Department and the IRS do not adopt this 
comment. As previously described in this preamble, section 6103(j) 
states that the Secretary ``shall furnish'' returns and return 
information, upon the request of the Secretary of Commerce, to the 
Bureau ``for the purpose of, but only to the extent necessary in, the 
structuring of censuses and national economic accounts and conducting 
related statistical activities authorized by law.'' These regulations 
provide for disclosure to the Bureau that is fully consistent with that 
statutory mandate.

[[Page 93175]]

E. Modification To Clarify ``Taxpayer Identity Information''

    No comments were received regarding the definition of taxpayer 
identity information. Proposed Sec.  301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(i)(A) is 
the first instance of where that term is used and includes the 
parenthetical ``(as defined under section 6103(b)(6) of the Code).'' 
Other references to taxpayer identity information in the proposed 
regulations lack that parenthetical descriptor. To provide consistency, 
the final regulations modify the proposed regulations to include that 
descriptor. See Sec. Sec.  301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(ii)(A) (regarding 
taxpayer identity information of taxpayers engaged in a trade or 
business); 301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(ii)(P) (regarding taxpayer identity 
information of a parent corporation, shareholder, partner, and employer 
identity information); 301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(1)(iii)(A) (regarding 
taxpayer identity information of a tax-exempt organization); 
301.6103(j)(1)-1(b)(3)(i)(A)(1) (regarding taxpayer identity 
information reflected on returns of corporations); 301.6103(j)(1)-
1(b)(3)(i)(B)(2) (regarding taxpayer identity information from Form SS-
4, Application for Employer Identification Number).

Special Analyses

I. Regulatory Planning and Review

    Pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement, Review of Treasury 
Regulations under Executive Order 12866 (June 9, 2023), tax regulatory 
actions issued by the IRS are not subject to the requirements of 
section 6 of Executive Order 12866, as amended. Therefore, a regulatory 
impact assessment is not required.

II. Regulatory Flexibility Act

    Because these regulations would not impose any requirements on 
small entities, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) 
does not apply. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Internal Revenue 
Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking was submitted to the Chief 
Counsel for the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration 
for comment on its impact on small business. The Chief Counsel for the 
Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration did not provide 
any written comments.

III. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
requires that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take 
certain other actions before issuing a final rule that includes any 
Federal mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a 
State, local, or Tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private 
sector, of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for 
inflation. In 2024, that threshold was $200 million. This rule does not 
include any Federal mandate that may result in expenditures by State, 
local, or Tribal governments, or by the private sector in excess of 
that threshold.

IV. Executive Order 13132: Federalism

    Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) prohibits an agency from 
publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either 
imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local 
governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts State law, 
unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of 
section 6 of the Executive order. These regulations do not have 
federalism implications and do not impose substantial direct compliance 
costs on State and local governments or preempt State law within the 
meaning of the Executive order.

V. Congressional Review Act

    Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), 
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule 
as not a major rule, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Drafting Information

    The principal author of these regulations is Elizabeth Erickson of 
the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and 
Administration). However, other personnel from the Treasury Department 
and the IRS also participated in their development.
