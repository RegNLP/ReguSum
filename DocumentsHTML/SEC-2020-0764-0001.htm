[Release Nos. 33-10765; 34-88358; IC-33814; File No. S7-23-18]

Correction

    In rule document 2020-05526 in the issue of Friday, May 1, 2020, 
make the following corrections:
    1. On page 26058, in the first column, footnote 1056 should read 
``\1056\ The Commission recently adopted rules requiring registrants to 
include a hyperlink to each exhibit identified in the exhibit index in 
any registration statement or report that is required to include 
exhibits under 17 CFR 229.601 (Item 601 of Regulation S-K) or under 
Form F-10 or Form 20- F. In connection with this rulemaking, commenters 
indicated that hyperlinking would make it easier and reduce the amount 
of time required for investors to navigate to related documents. See 
Exhibit Hyperlinks and HTML Format, Release No. 34-80132 (Mar. 1, 2017) 
[82 FR 14130 (Mar. 17, 2017)] at nn.85 and 86. In 2019, the Commission 
adopted amendments to its investment company registration forms, 
including Forms N-3, N-4, and N-6, to require hyperlinks to exhibits 
required to be filed with the registration statement. See FAST Act 
Adopting Release, supra note 501.
    2. The table entitled ``Rule 498a PRA Estimates'' appearing on 
pages 26087-26089, should appear as follows:
