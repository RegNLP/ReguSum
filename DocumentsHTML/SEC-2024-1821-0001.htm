SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Part 200

[Release No. 33-11337; 34-101867]


Commission's Organization and Program Management Regulations

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or 
``Commission'') is adopting technical amendments to update information 
relating to its regional offices listed in the Commission's 
Organization and Program Management regulations.

DATES: Effective December 16, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Tiffany Moseley, Senior Special 
Counsel, (202) 551-5100, Office of the General Counsel, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-9150.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

I. Background

    The Commission is amending the information in its Organization and 
Program Management regulations at 17 CFR 200.11 (Head Quarters Office--
Regional Office Relationships) to reflect the closure of the Salt Lake 
Regional Office on October 26, 2024 and to update the addresses of 
regional offices that have moved.

II. Administrative Law Matters

    The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (``APA''), that the amendments to its rules to update the 
information for its regional offices relate solely to the agency's 
organization, procedure, or practice. Accordingly, the APA's provisions 
regarding notice of rulemaking and opportunity for public comment do 
not apply.\1\ The Commission also finds that because these amendments 
do not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency 
parties there is good cause not to provide advance publication of the 
amendments under the APA and therefore the amendments are effective on 
December 16, 2024.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).
    \2\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For the same reasons, the provisions of the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act \3\ and the provisions of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act \4\ do not apply. These amendments also do 
not contain any collection of information requirements as defined by 
the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.\5\ Further, because the amendments 
impose no new burdens on private parties, the Commission does not 
believe that the amendments will have any impact on competition for 
purposes of section 23(a)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Exchange Act'').\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C) (the term ``rule'' does not include ``any 
rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does not 
substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency 
parties'').
    \4\ 5 U.S.C. 601(2) (provisions only applicable when notice and 
comment required by the APA).
    \5\ 5 CFR 1320.3.
    \6\ 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Statutory Authority

    These technical amendments are adopted pursuant to statutory 
authority granted to the Commission under section 19(a) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and section 23(a) of the Exchange Act.

List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 200
