Mortality Tables for Determining Present Value Under Defined 
Benefit Pension Plans

AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

ACTION: Final regulations.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document sets forth final regulations prescribing 
mortality tables to be used for most defined benefit pension plans. The 
tables specify the probability of survival year-by-year for an 
individual based on age, gender, and other factors. The tables are used 
(together with other actuarial assumptions) to calculate the present 
value of a stream of expected future benefit payments for purposes of 
determining the minimum funding requirements for the plan. These 
mortality tables are also relevant for determining the minimum required 
amount of a lump-sum distribution from such a plan. These regulations 
affect participants in, beneficiaries of, employers maintaining, and 
administrators of certain defined benefit pension plans.

DATES: 
    Effective date: These regulations are effective October 20, 2023.
    Applicability date: These regulations apply to valuation dates 
occurring on or after January 1, 2024.
    Incorporation by reference: The incorporation by reference of 
certain publications listed in the rule is approved by the Director of 
the Federal Register as of October 20, 2023.

Malik or Linda Marshall at (202) 317-6700; concerning the construction 
of the base mortality tables and the static mortality tables for 2024,

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 

Background

    Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) prescribes minimum 
funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans, and section 430 
specifies the minimum funding requirements that apply generally to 
defined benefit plans that are not multiemployer plans.\1\ Section 
430(a) defines the minimum required contribution for a plan by 
reference to the plan's funding target for the plan year. Under section 
430(d)(1), a plan's funding target for a plan year generally is the 
present value of all benefits accrued or earned under the plan as of 
the first day of that plan year.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ Section 302 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974, Public Law 93-406, 88 Stat. 829 (1974), as amended (ERISA), 
sets forth funding rules that are parallel to those in section 412 
of the Code, and section 303 of ERISA sets forth additional funding 
rules for defined benefit plans (other than multiemployer plans) 
that are parallel to those in section 430 of the Code. Pursuant to 
section 101 of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1978, 5 U.S.C. App., as 
amended, the Secretary of the Treasury has interpretive jurisdiction 
over the subject matter addressed in these regulations for purposes 
of ERISA, as well as the Code. Thus, these Treasury regulations 
issued under section 430 of the Code also apply for purposes of 
section 303 of ERISA. Similarly, Treasury regulations under sections 
431 and 433 apply for purposes of sections 304 and 306 of ERISA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 430(h)(3) provides rules regarding the mortality tables to 
be used under section 430. Under section 430(h)(3)(A), except as 
provided in section 430(h)(3)(C) or (D), the Secretary is to prescribe 
by regulation mortality tables to be used in determining any present 
value or making any computation under section 430. Those mortality 
tables are to be based on the actual mortality experience of pension 
plan participants and projected trends in that experience. In 
prescribing those mortality tables, the Secretary is required to take 
into account results of available independent studies of mortality of 
individuals covered by pension plans. Under section 430(h)(3)(B), the 
Secretary is required to revise any mortality table in effect under 
section 430(h)(3)(A) at least every 10 years to reflect actual 
mortality experience of pension plan participants and projected trends 
in that experience. Under section 430(h)(3)(C), a plan sponsor may 
request the Secretary's approval to use plan-specific substitute 
mortality tables that meet requirements specified in the statute rather 
than the generally applicable mortality tables. If approved, the 
substitute mortality tables are used to determine present values and 
make computations under section 430 during the period of consecutive 
plan years (not to exceed 10) specified in the request.
    Section 430(h)(3)(D) provides for the use of separate mortality 
tables with respect to certain individuals who are entitled to benefits 
on account of disability. These separate mortality tables are permitted 
to be used with respect to disabled individuals in lieu of the 
generally applicable mortality tables

[[Page 72358]]

provided pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(A). The Secretary is to 
establish separate tables for individuals with disabilities occurring 
in plan years beginning before January 1, 1995, and for individuals 
with disabilities occurring in later plan years, with the mortality 
tables for individuals with disabilities occurring in those later plan 
years applying only to individuals who are disabled within the meaning 
of Title II of the Social Security Act.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ Mortality tables that were permitted to be used for disabled 
participants under section 412(l)(7)(C)(iii)(I) as in effect before 
2008 were provided in Rev. Rul. 96-7, 96-3 IRB 12. Notice 2008-29, 
2008-1 CB 637, adopted those tables for use under section 
430(h)(3)(D).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 417(e)(3) generally provides that the present value of 
certain benefits under a qualified pension plan (including single-sum 
distributions) must not be less than the present value of the accrued 
benefit using applicable interest rates and the applicable mortality 
table. Section 417(e)(3)(B) defines the term ``applicable mortality 
table'' as the mortality table specified for the plan year for minimum 
funding purposes under section 430(h)(3)(A) (without regard to the 
rules for substitute mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(C) or 
mortality tables for disabled individuals under section 430(h)(3)(D)), 
modified as appropriate by the Secretary. The modifications made by the 
Secretary to the section 430(h)(3)(A) mortality table to determine the 
section 417(e)(3)(B) applicable mortality table are not addressed in 
these regulations. Revenue Ruling 2007-67, 2007-2 CB 1047, describes 
the modifications that are currently applied to determine the section 
417(e)(3)(B) applicable mortality table.
    Final regulations under section 430(h)(3) were published in the 
Federal Register on October 5, 2017, in TD 9826, 82 FR 46388 (the 2017 
regulations). Section 1.430(h)(3)-1 prescribes base mortality tables 
and a set of mortality improvement rates, which may be reflected 
through the use of either generational mortality tables or static 
mortality tables. The generational mortality tables are a series of 
mortality tables, one for each year of birth, each of which fully 
reflects projected trends in mortality rates. The static mortality 
tables (which are updated annually \3\) use a single mortality table 
for all years of birth to approximate the present value that would be 
determined using the generational mortality tables.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ Static mortality tables were published in Notice 2017-60, 
2017-43 IRB 365, Notice 2018-02, 2018-2 IRB 281, Notice 2019-26, 
2019-15 IRB 943, Notice 2019-67, 2019-52 IRB 1510, Notice 2020-85, 
2020-51 IRB 1645, and Notice 2022-22, 2022-20 IRB 1057.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The mortality tables included in the 2017 regulations are based on 
the mortality tables included in the RP-2014 Mortality Tables Report 
\4\ (referred to in this preamble as the RP-2014 mortality tables), 
which was released by the Retirement Plan Experience Committee (RPEC) 
of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) in October 2014 (as revised in 
November 2014), and a set of mortality improvement rates as released by 
RPEC in the Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2016 Report.\5\ In 2016, 
RPEC initiated a study of private-sector retirement plans in the U.S. 
in order to provide an update to the RP-2014 mortality tables, and in 
2019, RPEC issued the Pri-2012 Private Retirement Plans Mortality 
Tables Report (Pri-2012 Report).\6\ In October 2021, RPEC published the 
Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021 Report (MP-2021 Report), which 
includes the latest mortality improvement scale issued by RPEC.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The standards prescribed for developing the mortality tables under 
section 430(h)(3)(A) are the same as the standards that are prescribed 
for developing mortality tables for multiemployer plans under section 
431(c)(6)(D)(iv)(II) (which are used to determine current liability in 
order to determine the minimum full funding limitation under section 
431(c)(6)(B)). These standards also apply for CSEC plans described in 
section 414(y) for purposes of developing mortality tables that are 
used for purposes of section 433(h)(3)(B)(i) (to determine current 
liability in order to determine the minimum full funding limitation 
under section 433(c)(2)(C) and the funded current liability percentage 
under section 433(i)).
    Proposed regulations to update the mortality tables issued under 
section 430(h)(3) and make certain other changes regarding those tables 
were published in the Federal Register on April 28, 2022 (87 FR 25161) 
(the proposed regulations). Five comments on the proposed regulations 
were received. No commenters requested to speak at the scheduled public 
hearing; accordingly, the public hearing was canceled.
    On October 27, 2022, RPEC released a report titled the ``RPEC 2022 
Mortality Improvement Update.'' \8\ Unlike RPEC's previously issued 
reports regarding mortality improvement, this report does not include a 
new mortality improvement scale. RPEC noted that, as of the date of 
that report, the most recent year for which full-year mortality data 
was available was 2020, which was severely affected by the COVID-19 
pandemic. RPEC concluded that it would not be appropriate to 
incorporate, without adjustment, the substantially higher rates of 
mortality experience from 2020 into the models RPEC had previously used 
to project future mortality.\9\ Therefore, RPEC chose not to release a 
new mortality improvement scale in 2022. Instead, RPEC recommended the 
use of an assumed increase in mortality rates to reflect the impact of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, which would be phased out after an appropriate 
period. RPEC did not recommend a specific level for this assumed 
increase but provided data about mortality rates for 2020 through the 
first half of 2022 and provided examples of assumed increases that 
could be used (including the assumed increase used in the 2022 Annual 
Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors 
Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ This report is available at <a href="https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2022/rpec-mortality-improvement/">https://www.soa.org/resources/research-reports/2022/rpec-mortality-improvement/</a>.
    \9\ RPEC noted that, if it had used its standard graduation 
model and had included 2020 data in accordance with its usual 
practice, this would have had the effect of elevating mortality 
improvement rates for periods prior to the pandemic.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Section 335 of the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 (SECURE 2.0 Act), which 
was enacted on December 29, 2022 as Division T of the Consolidated 
Appropriations Act, 2023, Public Law 117-328 (136 Stat. 4459), 
instructs the Secretary or the Secretary's delegate to amend the 
regulations under section 430(h)(3)(A) no later than June 30, 2024. 
Under this provision, for valuation dates occurring during or after 
2024, the mortality improvement rates specified in those regulations 
must not assume for years beyond the valuation date mortality 
improvements at any age that are greater than 0.78 percent. Section 335 
of the SECURE 2.0 Act also instructs the Secretary (or delegate) to 
modify the 0.78 percent limitation to reflect material changes in the 
overall rate of improvement projected by the Social Security 
Administration.

[[Page 72359]]

    After consideration of public comments received on the proposed 
regulations (and taking into account section 335 of the SECURE 2.0 
Act), the proposed regulations are adopted by this Treasury decision, 
with certain changes. These changes include: (1) a delay in the 
applicability date; (2) modifications in the mortality improvement 
rates to reflect the expected ongoing impact of COVID-19 on mortality 
rates and to reflect the 0.78 percent annual cap on mortality 
improvement rates as required by section 335 of the SECURE 2.0 Act; and 
(3) a minor change related to the treatment of individuals who are not 
identified as male or female.

Summary of Comments and Explanation of Revisions

    These regulations set forth the updated methodology for determining 
the generally applicable mortality tables that are used to calculate 
present value under section 430 of the Code. Pursuant to section 
417(e)(3)(B), a modified version of these tables is used for purposes 
of determining the amount of a single-sum distribution (or another 
accelerated form of distribution). In addition, these tables are used 
to determine current liability for multiemployer plans under section 
431(c)(6) and CSEC plans under section 433(h).
    The updated methodology for determining the generally applicable 
mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(A) is issued pursuant to the 
requirement under section 430(h)(3)(B) to revise the mortality tables 
used under section 430 to reflect the actual mortality experience of 
pension plan participants and projected trends in that experience as 
well as the requirement under section 335 of the SECURE 2.0 Act that 
mortality improvement rates provided under the regulations for years 
after the year that includes the applicable valuation date may not 
exceed 0.78 percent per year. As under the 2017 regulations and the 
proposed regulations, the methodology for determining generally 
applicable mortality tables involves the separate determination of base 
mortality tables and the projection of mortality improvement.

A. Base Mortality Tables

    These regulations adopt the base mortality tables set forth in the 
proposed regulations for use under section 430(h)(3)(A) of the Code, 
which are derived from the tables set forth in the Pri-2012 Report. No 
commenter suggested any alternative source for base mortality tables.
    Like the base mortality tables provided in the 2017 regulations, 
the base mortality tables set forth in these regulations are gender-
distinct and provide separate non-annuitant and annuitant mortality 
rates. The base mortality tables have a base year of 2012 (the central 
year of the experience study used to develop the mortality tables in 
the Pri-2012 Report). These base tables generally have the same 
mortality rates as the employee and non-disabled annuitant mortality 
rates (amounts weighted) that were released by RPEC in connection with 
the Pri-2012 Report. However, these base tables also include non-
annuitant mortality rates for ages below 18 and above 80 and annuitant 
mortality rates for ages below age 50. This generally is the same 
approach that was used to develop the base mortality tables in the 2017 
regulations. The preamble to the proposed regulations describes the 
methodology that was used to develop non-annuitant mortality rates for 
ages below age 18 and above age 80 and annuitant mortality rates for 
ages below age 50. See 87 FR 25161, 25163.

B. Mortality Improvement

    These regulations adopt the methodology set forth in the proposed 
regulations regarding the adjustment of the base mortality tables to 
reflect expected trends in mortality improvement but use different 
mortality improvement rates. The proposed regulations applied the Scale 
MP-2021 Rates (the mortality improvement scale in the MP-2021 Report) 
for valuation dates in the 2023 calendar year. This mortality 
improvement scale was developed using the same underlying methodology 
used to develop earlier mortality improvement scales but reflects 
historical population data through 2019 and the change to the RPEC-
selected assumptions for the long-term rate of mortality improvement 
that was first incorporated in the Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2020 
Report.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ This report is available at <a href="https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2020/mortality-improvement-scale-mp-2020.pdf">https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/experience-studies/2020/mortality-improvement-scale-mp-2020.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    One commenter expressed concern that the expected long-term 
improvements in longevity reflected in the MP-2021 Report may be overly 
optimistic and suggested that regulations apply a cap on the long-term 
mortality improvement rates used. Another commenter recommended that 
future mortality rates be increased to reflect the long-term impact of 
COVID-19.
    After considering all the comments and the RPEC 2022 Mortality 
Improvement Update, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury 
Department) and the IRS have decided to adopt a modified version of the 
MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale for valuation dates occurring on or 
after January 1, 2024. The mortality improvement scale applicable for 
valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 2024, which is 
referred to as the 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates, is based on the 
Scale MP-2021 Rates. However, the 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates 
reflect a modification to the Scale MP-2021 Rates that eliminates any 
mortality improvement during 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023 (while 
retaining any projected mortality deterioration for those years under 
the MP-2021 Mortality Improvement Scale).\11\ In addition, in response 
to the statutory instruction in section 335 of the SECURE 2.0 Act, the 
2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 incorporates a cap on mortality improvement 
rates of 0.78 percent per year for years after 2024.\12\ This cap on 
mortality improvement rates is statutorily required by a clear 
statutory instruction, and public comment on the cap rate is 
unnecessary.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ Because the mortality rates provided in these regulations 
apply beginning in 2024 (that is, after the height of the COVID-19 
pandemic), the significantly higher rates of mortality experience 
during 2020 through 2023 are not determinative of mortality rates 
for later years. However, the Treasury Department and the IRS expect 
that mortality in the future will be marginally higher than what was 
projected based on mortality experience prior to the COVID-19 
pandemic. This expectation has been reflected through the 
elimination of any mortality improvement assumption for the years 
2020 through 2023.
    \12\ Because the 0.78 percent cap applies to rates for years 
after the year that includes the applicable valuation date, the 
first impact of that cap will be on the mortality rates that are 
projected to apply in 2025.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Treasury Department and the IRS intend to consider new data 
regarding mortality trends of the general population as it becomes 
available (including future reports and mortality improvement scales 
issued by RPEC, as well as projections of mortality improvement issued 
by the Social Security Administration) and to specify new mortality 
improvement rates that reflect updated data when future modifications 
become appropriate. Those new mortality improvement rates will 
incorporate the cap on mortality improvement rates described in section 
335 of the SECURE 2.0 Act (including a change to the level of the 0.78 
percent cap on annual mortality improvement rates as a result of any 
material changes in the overall rate of improvement

[[Page 72360]]

projected by the Social Security Administration).

C. Use of Static Tables for Small Plans

    The 2017 regulations provide for the use of separate generational 
non-annuitant and annuitant mortality tables and separate static non-
annuitant and annuitant mortality tables. However, the proposed 
regulations provided for the elimination of the use of static mortality 
tables other than for small plans. This change was proposed because the 
Treasury Department and the IRS believe that there was no longer a need 
to allow the use of static mortality tables for larger plans (as most 
actuarial firms have the capability to use generational mortality 
tables) and to minimize anti-selection by plan sponsors who determine 
that the use of static mortality tables results in lower minimum 
funding requirements. No commenters objected to this change, and these 
regulations adopt that change.

D. Individuals Not Identified as Male or Female

    One commenter requested that final regulations clarify how the 
mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(A) are applied in the case of 
a participant or beneficiary who identifies as nonbinary. To address 
this issue, and to clarify how these tables should be applied for the 
portion of a plan's population for whom gender data is not available, 
the regulations provide that the plan's actuary must use a reasonable 
approach in applying the section 430(h)(3)(A) mortality tables with 
respect to the portion of a plan's population whose gender is not 
identified as male or female (for example, a plan participant who 
identifies as nonbinary or for whom gender is not known). The 
regulations include two examples of reasonable approaches that may be 
used for this purpose. These two approaches are merely two reasonable 
methods for determining liabilities with respect to individuals for 
whom male or female gender is not identified, and other reasonable 
approaches may be appropriate.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ For example, it might be reasonable to apply an approach 
based on an equal weighting of male mortality rates and female 
mortality rates if the gender ratio of the portion of the plan 
population for whom male or female gender is identified is 
sufficiently close to 50 percent male and 50 percent female.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the first approach, the liability for an individual is 
determined as the weighted average of the liability calculated as if 
the individual were male and the liability calculated as if the 
individual were female, using an appropriate weighting that takes into 
account the distribution of gender in the plan's population for 
individuals for whom gender is identified. For example, if the gender 
distribution in a plan's population for whom the gender is identified 
is \2/3\ male and \1/3\ female, the liability calculated for the 
individual would be equal to \2/3\ of the liability calculated as if 
the individual were male and \1/3\ of the liability calculated as if 
the individual were female.
    The second approach might be used in connection with actuarial 
software that is not able to apply a weight to individuals in the plan 
census. Under the second approach, either male or female status is 
assigned randomly to an individual for whom male or female gender is 
not identified in a manner that is expected to result in an appropriate 
proportion of males and females for the plan population that takes into 
account the distribution of gender for individuals in the plan's 
population for whom gender is identified. For example, if the gender 
distribution in a plan population for whom the gender is identified is 
\2/3\ male and \1/3\ female, a gender may be assigned to an individual 
for whom gender is not identified based on the individual's birthdate, 
with someone born in the first 8 months of the year assigned male 
gender and someone born in the last 4 months of the year assigned 
female gender.

Applicability Date

    These regulations apply for valuation dates occurring on or after 
January 1, 2024.

Effect of Regulations on Previously Approved Substitute Mortality 
Tables

    The 2017 regulations also included rules regarding the use of plan-
specific substitute mortality tables under section 430(h)(3)(C), which 
are set forth in Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-2. Section 1.430(h)(3)-2(c)(6)(ii) 
provides for the early termination of the use of substitute mortality 
tables in certain circumstances, including in conjunction with a 
replacement of the mortality tables specified in Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-1. 
Under Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-2(c)(6)(ii)(E), the early termination in 
conjunction with a replacement of the generally applicable mortality 
tables will apply as of a date specified in guidance published in the 
Internal Revenue Bulletin. As stated in the preamble to the proposed 
regulations, the Treasury Department and the IRS generally will not 
require that the use of previously approved substitute mortality tables 
be terminated solely as a result of replacement of the generally 
applicable mortality tables.
    Proposed regulations modifying the rules for approving plan-
specific substitute mortality tables are being published in the 
proposed rules section of this issue of the Federal Register. Those 
regulations are proposed to apply to plan years beginning on or after 
January 1, 2025. Until amendments to the plan-specific substitute 
mortality regulations are finalized--and an updated revenue procedure 
that reflects the final regulations is issued--the Treasury Department 
and the IRS will not require that any previously approved plan-specific 
substitute mortality tables be terminated pursuant to Sec.  
1.430(h)(3)-2(c)(6)(ii)(E).

Incorporation by Reference

    Section 1.430(h)(3)-1(b)(1)(iii) of these regulations provides that 
the mortality improvement rates used to construct generational tables 
to be used for valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 2024, 
are the 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates as described in the third 
paragraph of section B of the Summary of Comments and Explanation of 
Revisions in this preamble. The Office of the Federal Register (OFR) 
has regulations concerning incorporation by reference. 1 CFR part 51. 
These regulations require that agencies must discuss in the preamble to 
a rule or proposed rule the way in which materials that the agency 
incorporates by reference are reasonably available to interested 
persons, and how interested parties can obtain the materials. 1 CFR 
51.5(b). The 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates may be found at

Special Analyses

    Pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement, Review of Treasury 
Regulations under Executive Order 12866 (June 9, 2023), tax regulatory 
actions issued by the IRS are not subject to the requirements of 
section 6 of Executive Order 12866, as amended. Therefore, a regulatory 
impact assessment is not required.
    Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6), it 
is hereby certified that the regulations will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

The only provision that increases regulatory burden is Sec.  
1.430(h)(3)-1(b), which generally requires the use of generational 
mortality tables. However, under Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-1(c), small entities 
are not required to use generational mortality tables. Therefore, these 
regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a 
substantial number of small entities.
    Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires 
that agencies assess anticipated costs and benefits and take certain 
other actions before issuing a final rule that includes any Federal 
mandate that may result in expenditures in any one year by a State, 
local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private 
sector, of $100 million in 1995 dollars, updated annually for 
inflation. These regulations do not include any Federal mandate that 
may result in expenditures by State, local, or tribal governments, or 
by the private sector in excess of that threshold.
    Executive Order 13132 (Federalism) prohibits an agency from 
publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either 
imposes substantial, direct compliance costs on State and local 
governments, and is not required by statute, or preempts State law, 
unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of 
section 6 of the Executive order. These regulations do not have 
federalism implications, impose substantial direct compliance costs on 
State and local governments, or preempt State law within the meaning of 
the Executive order.
    Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the proposed regulations 
that preceded these regulations were submitted to the Chief Counsel for 
Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment on their 
impact on small business.
    Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (5 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), 
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs designated this rule 
as not a major rule, as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).

Drafting Information

    The principal authors of these regulations are Arslan Malik and 
Linda S.F. Marshall of the Office of Associate Chief Counsel (Employee 
Benefits, Exempt Organizations, and Employment Taxes). However, other 
personnel from the Treasury Department and the IRS participated in the 
development of these regulations.

Par. 2. Section 1.430(h)(3)-1 is revised to read as follows:


Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-1  Mortality tables used to determine present value.

    (a) Overview--(1) Standard mortality tables. This section sets 
forth rules for the mortality tables to be used in determining present 
value or making any computation under section 430. These mortality 
tables include--
    (i) Generational mortality tables described in paragraph (b) of 
this section; and
    (ii) Static mortality tables for small plans described in paragraph 
(c) of this section.
    (2) Alternative tables--(i) Plan-specific mortality tables. In lieu 
of using the mortality tables provided under this section, plan-
specific substitute mortality tables are permitted to be used for 
purposes of section 430 pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(C), provided that 
the requirements of Sec.  1.430(h)(3)-2 are satisfied.
    (ii) Disabled individuals. In lieu of using the mortality tables 
provided under this section, mortality tables for disabled individuals 
are permitted to be used pursuant to section 430(h)(3)(D). These tables 
are provided in guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. 
See Sec.  601.601(d) of this chapter.
    (3) Individuals not identified as either male or female. The 
mortality tables in this section are applied for an individual based on 
the individual's gender. With respect to the portion of a plan's 
population for which male or female gender is not identified (for 
example, because an individual identifies as nonbinary or because the 
gender information for an individual is not available), the plan's 
actuary must use a reasonable approach for determining liability. Some 
reasonable approaches for these individuals include--
    (i) Determining the liability for an individual for whom male or 
female gender is not identified as the weighted average of the 
liability calculated as if the individual were male and the liability 
calculated as if the individual were female, with an appropriate 
weighting that takes into account the distribution of gender for 
individuals in the plan's population for whom gender is identified; and
    (ii) Assigning either male or female status randomly to an 
individual for whom male or female gender is not identified in a manner 
that is expected to result in an appropriate proportion of males and 
females for the plan's population that takes into account the 
distribution of gender for individuals in the plan's population for 
whom gender is identified.
    (b) Generational mortality tables--(1) In general--(i) Construction 
of generational mortality tables. The generational mortality tables 
that are permitted to be used under section 430(h)(3)(A) and paragraph 
(a)(1)(i) of this section are constructed from the base mortality 
tables described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section and the 
mortality improvement rates described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this 
section, as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this 
section.
    (ii) Base mortality tables. The base mortality tables are set forth 
in paragraph (d) of this section.
    (iii) Mortality improvement rates--(A) Mortality improvement rates 
for valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 2024. Except as 
otherwise provided in this paragraph (b)(1)(iii), the mortality 
improvement rates for valuation dates occurring on or after January 1, 
2024, are the 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates as incorporated by 
reference pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)(iv)(A) of this section.

    (B) [Reserved]
    (2) Application of mortality improvement rates--(i) In general. 
Under the generational mortality tables

[[Page 72362]]

described in this paragraph (b), the probability of an individual's 
death at a particular age in the future is determined as the 
individual's base mortality rate that applies at that age (that is, the 
applicable mortality rate from the tables set forth in paragraph (d) of 
this section for that age, gender, and status as an annuitant or a non-
annuitant) multiplied by the cumulative mortality improvement factor 
for the individual's gender and for that age for the period from the 
base year for those mortality tables through the calendar year in which 
the individual is projected to reach the particular age. Paragraph 
(b)(3) of this section provides an example that shows how the base 
mortality tables in paragraph (d) of this section and the mortality 
improvement rates for valuation dates occurring during 2024 are 
combined to determine projected mortality rates.
    (ii) Cumulative mortality improvement factor. The cumulative 
mortality improvement factor for an age and gender for a period is the 
product of the annual mortality improvement factors for that age and 
gender for each year within that period.
    (iii) Annual mortality improvement factor. The annual mortality 
improvement factor for an age and gender for a year is 1 minus the 
mortality improvement rate that applies for that age and gender for 
that year. If that annual mortality improvement rate is greater than 1 
(corresponding to a negative mortality improvement rate), then the 
projected mortality rate for that age and gender for that year is 
greater than the projected mortality rate for the same age and gender 
for the preceding year.
    (3) Example of calculation--(i) Calculation of mortality rate. The 
mortality rate for 2024 that is applied to a male annuitant who is age 
68 in 2024 is equal to the product of the mortality rate under 
paragraph (d) of this section for a male annuitant who was age 68 in 
2012 (0.01418) and the cumulative mortality improvement factor 
calculated from the 2024 Adjusted Scale MP-2021 Rates for an age 68 
male from 2012 to 2024. The cumulative mortality improvement factor for 
age 68 males for the period from 2012 to 2024 is 0.9827, and the 
mortality rate for 2024 for male annuitants who are age 68 in that year 
is 0.01393, as shown in the following table.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    (ii) Probability of survival for an individual. After the projected 
mortality rates are derived for each age for each year, the rates are 
used to calculate the present value of a benefit stream that depends on 
the probability of survival year-by-year. For example, for purposes of 
calculating the present value (for a 2024 valuation date) of future 
payments in a benefit stream payable for a male annuitant who is age 68 
in 2024, the probability of survival for the annuitant is based on the 
mortality rate for a male annuitant who is age 68 in 2024 (0.01393), 
and the projected mortality rate for a male annuitant who will be age 
69 in 2025 (0.01507), age 70 in 2026 (0.01635), and so on.
    (4) Use of the tables--(i) Separate tables for annuitants and non-
annuitants. Separate mortality tables are provided for use with respect 
to annuitants and non-annuitants. The non-annuitant mortality tables 
are applied to determine the probability of survival for a non-
annuitant for the period before the non-annuitant is projected to 
commence receiving benefits. The annuitant mortality tables are applied 
to determine the present value of benefits for each annuitant. In 
addition, the annuitant mortality tables are applied for each non-
annuitant with respect to each assumed commencement of benefits for the 
period beginning with that assumed commencement. For purposes of this 
section, an annuitant means a plan participant who has commenced 
receiving benefits and a non-annuitant means a plan participant who has 
not yet commenced receiving benefits (for example, an active employee 
or a terminated vested participant). A participant whose benefit has 
partially commenced is treated as an annuitant with respect to the 
portion of the benefit that has commenced and treated as a non-
annuitant with respect to the balance of the benefit. In addition, with 
respect to a beneficiary of a participant, the annuitant mortality 
tables apply for the period beginning with each assumed commencement of 
benefits for the participant. If the participant has died (or to the 
extent the participant is assumed to die before commencing benefits), 
the annuitant mortality tables apply with respect to the beneficiary 
for the period beginning with each assumed commencement of benefits for 
the beneficiary.
    (ii) Examples of calculation using separate non-annuitant and 
annuitant tables. With respect to a 45-year-old active participant who 
is projected to commence receiving an annuity at age 55, the funding 
target is determined using the non-annuitant mortality tables for the 
period before the participant attains age 55 and using the annuitant 
mortality tables for the period ages 55 and above. Similarly, for a 45-
year-old terminated vested participant who is projected to commence an 
annuity at

[[Page 72363]]

age 65, the funding target is determined using the non-annuitant 
mortality tables for the period before the participant attains age 65 
and using the annuitant mortality tables for ages 65 and above.
    (c) Static mortality tables--(1) Availability of alternative tables 
for small plans--(i) In general. As an alternative to the generational 
mortality tables defined in paragraph (b) of this section, static 
mortality tables may be used for a small plan. The static mortality 
tables described in this paragraph (c) are constructed from the 
separate non-annuitant and annuitant static mortality tables described 
in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, combined using the procedure 
described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.
    (ii) Definition of small plan. For purposes of this paragraph (c), 
a small plan is defined as a plan with 500 or fewer total participants 
(including both active and inactive participants and beneficiaries of 
deceased participants) on the valuation date.
    (iii) Use of static mortality tables. The static mortality tables 
that are used for a valuation date are the static mortality tables for 
the calendar year that includes the valuation date.
    (iv) Publication of mortality tables. The static mortality tables 
for the 2024 calendar year are set forth in paragraph (e) of this 
section.

    Note 1 to paragraph (c)(1)(iv): The static mortality tables for 
valuation dates occurring in later calendar years will be published 
in the Internal Revenue Bulletin. See Sec.  601.601(d) of this 
chapter.

    (2) Development of static mortality tables--(i) Non-annuitant and 
annuitant mortality tables. The non-annuitant and annuitant static 
mortality tables are determined using the base mortality tables 
described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The rates in those 
base mortality tables are adjusted using the mortality improvement 
rates described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, in accordance 
with the rules set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.
    (ii) Combined static mortality tables. The static mortality tables 
described in this paragraph (c) are constructed from the separate non-
annuitant and annuitant static mortality tables pursuant to paragraph 
(c)(2)(i) of this section, blended using the weighting factors in 
paragraph (d) of this section. The weighting factors are applied to 
develop these combined static tables using the following equation: 
Combined mortality rate = [non-annuitant rate * (1 - weighting factor)] 
+ [annuitant rate * weighting factor].
    (3) Projection of mortality improvements--(i) General rule. Except 
as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section, the static 
mortality tables for a calendar year are determined by multiplying the 
applicable mortality rate for each age from the base mortality tables 
by both--
    (A) The cumulative mortality improvement factor (determined under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) for the period from 2012 through 
that calendar year; and
    (B) The cumulative mortality improvement factor (determined under 
paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section) for the period beginning in that 
calendar year and continuing beyond that calendar year for the number 
of years in the projection period described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of 
this section.
    (ii) Projection period for static mortality tables--(A) In general. 
The projection period is 8 years for males and 9 years for females, as 
adjusted based on age as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this 
section.
    (B) Age adjustment. For ages below 80, the projection period is 
increased by 1 year for each year below age 80. For ages above 80, the 
projection period is reduced (but not below zero) by \1/3\ year for 
each year above 80.
    (iii) Fractional projection periods. If for an age the number of 
years in the projection period determined under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of 
this section is not a whole number, then the mortality rate for that 
age is determined by using linear interpolation between--
    (A) The mortality rate for that age that would be determined under 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section if the number of years in the 
projection period were the next lower whole number; and
    (B) The mortality rate for that age that would be determined under 
paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section if the number of years in the 
projection period were the next higher whole number.
    (iv) Example. For example, at age 85 the projection period for a 
male is 6\1/3\ years (8 years minus \1/3\ year for each of the 5 years 
above age 80). For a valuation date in 2024, the mortality rate in the 
static mortality table for an 85-year-old male is based on a projection 
of mortality improvement for 6\1/3\ years beyond 2024. Under paragraph 
(c)(3)(iii) of this section, the mortality rate for an 85-year-old male 
annuitant in the static mortality table for 2024 is \2/3\ times the 
projected mortality rate for a male annuitant that age in 2030 plus \1/
3\ times the projected mortality rate for a male annuitant that age in 
2031. Accordingly, the mortality rate for an 85-year-old male annuitant 
in the static mortality table for 2024 is 0.08126 (\2/3\ times the 
projected mortality rate for an 85-year-old male annuitant in 2030 
(0.08146) plus \1/3\ times the projected mortality rate for an 85-year-
old male annuitant in 2031 (0.08086)).
    (d) Base mortality tables. The following are the base mortality 
tables. The base year for these tables is 2012.
