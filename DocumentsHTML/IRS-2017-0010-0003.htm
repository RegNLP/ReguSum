SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    This document contains final regulations that reflect changes in 
tax return due dates enacted by section 2006 of the Surface 
Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015, 
Public Law 114-41, 129 Stat. 443 (2015), as well as changes to 
information return due dates enacted by section 201 of the Protecting 
Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, Public Law 114-113, Div. Q, 129 
Stat. 2242 (2015). On July 20, 2017, the IRS published in the Federal 
Register temporary regulations (TD 9821 (82 FR 33441)) that conformed 
the due dates and the available extensions of time to file various tax 
returns and information returns to those provided by statute. The 
temporary regulations were applicable for tax returns and information 
returns filed after July 20, 2017, with an expiration date of July 17, 
2020.
    The IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (REG-128483-15 
(82 FR 33467)) cross-referencing the temporary regulations in the 
Federal Register the same day it published the temporary regulations. 
The IRS received no comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking, and 
no public hearing was requested or held.
    This Treasury Decision removes the temporary regulations and adopts 
the proposed regulations as final regulations with only nonsubstantive 
revisions. The revisions are discussed in the Explanation of 
Provisions.

Explanation of Provisions

    A detailed explanation of these regulations can be found in the

[[Page 5324]]

preamble to the temporary regulations. One additional provision of 
these regulations that is not discussed in the preamble to the 
temporary regulations is explained below.
    Section 1.6081-2(a)(1) of the proposed regulations addresses the 
extension of time for a partnership to file Form 1065, ``U.S. 
Partnership Return of Income,'' or Form 8804, ``Annual Return for 
Partnership Withholding Tax.'' Similarly, Sec.  1.6081-2(a)(2) of the 
final regulations in place prior to the publication of this Treasury 
Decision addressed the extension of time to file Form 1065-B, ``U.S. 
Return of Income for Electing Large Partnerships.'' Section 1101(b)(1) 
of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Public Law 114-74, 129 Stat. 625 
(2015), repealed part IV of subchapter K of chapter 1 of subtitle A of 
the Internal Revenue Code (Code), which, prior to repeal, provided in 
former sections 771 through 777 for the treatment of certain 
partnerships as electing large partnerships. The amendment was 
effective for returns filed for partnership taxable years beginning 
after December 31, 2017. As a consequence, electing large partnerships 
do not exist and Forms 1065-B will not be filed for taxable years 
beginning after December 31, 2017.
    Because Sec.  1.6081-2(a)(2) is therefore obsolete, and the only 
remaining effective provision in Sec.  1.6081-2(a) was Sec.  1.6081-
2(a)(1), this Treasury Decision removes Sec.  1.6081-2(a)(2) and 
redesignates proposed Sec.  1.6081-2(a)(1) as Sec.  1.6081-2(a). This 
change is purely ministerial and has no substantive effect. 
Accordingly, the IRS finds good cause for dispensing with notice and 
public comment pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (c) and with a delayed 
effective date pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d) for this change.

Special Analyses

    These regulations are not subject to review under section 6(b) of 
Executive Order 12866 pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement (April 
11, 2018) between the Department of the Treasury and the Office of 
Management and Budget regarding review of tax regulations.
    Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) it 
is hereby certified that this final rule will not have a significant 
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. These 
regulations only update the due dates and extensions of time to file 
certain collections of information and include some existing regulatory 
language concerning collections of information that affect small 
entities for the convenience of the reader.
    Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed 
rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Chief 
Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration for comment 
on their impact on small business. No comments were received from the 
Small Business Administration.

Drafting Information

    The principal author of these regulations is Jonathan R. Black 
formerly of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel (Procedure and 
Administration).

    (a) Every bank (as defined in section 581) maintaining a common 
trust fund shall make a return of income of the common trust fund, 
regardless of the amount of its taxable income. Member banks of an 
affiliated group that serve as co-trustees with respect to a common 
trust fund must act jointly in making a return for the fund. If a bank 
maintains more than one common trust fund, a separate return shall be 
made for each.

[[Page 5325]]

No particular form is prescribed for making the return under this 
section, but Form 1065 may be used if it is designated by the bank as 
the return of a common trust fund. The return shall be made for the 
taxable year of the common trust fund and shall be filed on or before 
the date prescribed by section 6072(b) with the service center 
prescribed in the relevant Internal Revenue Service revenue procedure, 
publication, form, or instructions to the form (see Sec.  601.601(d)(2) 
of this chapter). Such return shall state specifically with respect to 
the fund the items of gross income and the deductions allowed by 
subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code, shall include each 
participant's name and address, the participant's proportionate share 
of taxable income or net loss (exclusive of gains and losses from sales 
or exchanges of capital assets), the participant's proportionate share 
of gains and losses from sales or exchanges of capital assets, and the 
participant's share of items which enter into the determination of the 
tax imposed by section 56. See Sec. Sec.  1.584-2 and 1.58-5. If the 
common trust fund is maintained by two or more banks that are members 
of the same affiliated group, the return must also identify the member 
bank in the group that has contributed each participant's property or 
money to the fund. A copy of the plan of the common trust fund must be 
filed with the return. If, however, a copy of such plan has once been 
filed with a return, it need not again be filed if the return contains 
a statement showing when and where it was filed. If the plan is amended 
in any way after such copy has been filed, a copy of the amendment must 
be filed with the return for the taxable year in which the amendment 
was made. For the signing of a return of a bank with respect to common 
trust funds, see Sec.  1.6062-1, relating to the manner prescribed for 
the signing of a return of a corporation.
