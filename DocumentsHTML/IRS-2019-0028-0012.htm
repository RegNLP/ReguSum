Sec.  1.199A-8   Deduction for income attributable to domestic 
production activities of specified agricultural or horticultural 
cooperatives.

* * * * *
    (d) * * *
    (1) Permitted amount-- * * *
    (2) * * *
    (i) * * * A Specified Cooperative is permitted to pass through an 
amount equal to the portion of the Specified Cooperative's section 
199A(g) deduction that is allowed with respect to the portion of the 
cooperative's QPAI that is attributable to the qualified payments the 
Specified Cooperative distributed to the patron during the taxable year 
and identified on the notice required in Sec.  1.199A-7(f)(3) on an 
attachment to or on the Form 1099-PATR, Taxable Distributions Received 
From Cooperatives (Form 1099-PATR), (or any successor form) issued by 
the Specified Cooperative to the patron, unless otherwise provided by 
the instructions to the Form 1099-PATR. * * *
* * * * *
    (3) * * * The Specified Cooperative must report the amount of 
section 199A(g) deduction passed through to the patron on an attachment 
to or on the Form 1099-PATR (or any successor form) issued by the 
Specified Cooperative to the patron, unless otherwise provided by the 
instructions to the Form 1099-PATR.
* * * * *
    (e) * * *
    (3) * * *
    (ii) * * * C's QPAI and taxable income both equal $1,000 ($1,800-
$800). * * *
    (4) * * *
    (ii) * * * C's section 199A(g) deduction attributable to patronage 
sources is the same as the deduction calculated by the nonexempt 
Specified Cooperative in Example 3 in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.
* * * * *
    (6) * * *
    (i) * * * D pays $300,000 for its patrons' corn at the time the 
grain was delivered in the form of per-unit retain allocations and its 
W-2 wages (as defined in Sec.  1.199A-11) for 2020 total $300,000. * * 
*
    (ii) * * * D's QPAI and taxable income is $1,200,000. D's section 
199A(g) deduction for its taxable year 2020 is $108,000 (.09 x 
$1,200,000). Because this amount is less than 50% of D's W-2 wages, the 
entire amount is allowed as a section 199A(g) deduction. * * * The 
section 199A(g) deduction of $108,000 is applied to, and reduces, D's 
taxable income.
    (7) * * *
    (i) * * * D declares a patronage dividend for its 2020 taxable year 
of $900,000, which it pays on March 15, 2021. * * * On March 15, 2021, 
Patron A receives a $9,000 patronage dividend that is a qualified 
payment under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section from D. In the 
notice that accompanies the patronage dividend, Patron A is designated 
a $1,080 section 199A(g) deduction. Under paragraph (a) of this 
section, Patron A may claim a $1,080 section 199A(g) deduction for the 
taxable year ending December 31, 2021, subject to the limitations set 
forth under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. * * *
    (ii) Under paragraph (d)(7) of this section, D is required to 
reduce its section 1382 deduction of $1,200,000 by the $108,000 section 
199A(g) deduction passed through to patrons (whether D pays patronage 
dividends on book or Federal income tax net earnings). As a 
consequence, D is entitled to a section 1382 deduction for the taxable 
year ending December 31, 2020, in the amount of $1,092,000 ($1,200,000-
$108,000) and to a section 199A(g) deduction in the amount of $108,000 
($1,200,000 x .09). * * *
    (8) * * *
    (i) * * * In 2020, D pays its patrons a $400,000 ($900,000-$500,000 
already paid) patronage dividend in cash or a combination of cash and 
qualified written notices of allocation. Under paragraph (d)(7) of this 
section and section 1382, D is allowed a deduction of $1,092,000 
($1,200,000-$108,000 section 199A(g) deduction), whether patronage net 
earnings are distributed on book or Federal income tax net earnings.
    (ii) The patrons will have received a gross amount of $1,200,000 in 
qualified payments under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section from 
Cooperative D ($300,000 paid as per-unit retain allocations, $500,000 
paid during the taxable year as advances, and the additional $400,000 
paid as patronage dividends). If D passes through its entire section 
199A(g) deduction to its patrons by providing the notice required by 
paragraph (d)(3) of this section, then the patrons will be allowed a 
$108,000 section 199A(g) deduction, resulting in a net $1,092,000 
taxable distribution from D. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(8) of this 
section, any of the $1,200,000 received by patrons that are Specified 
Cooperatives from D is not taken into account for purposes of 
calculating the patrons' section 199A(g) deduction. * * *
    (f) * * * In the case described in section 199A(g)(5)(B), where a 
Specified Cooperative is a partner in a partnership, the partnership 
must separately identify and report on the Schedule K-1 of the Form 
1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income (or any successor form) issued 
to the Specified Cooperative partner the cooperative's share of gross 
receipts and related deductions, W-2 wages, and COGS, unless otherwise 
provided by the instructions to the Form. * * *
