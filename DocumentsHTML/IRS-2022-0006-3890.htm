Affordability of Employer Coverage for Family Members of 
Employees; Correction

AGENCY: Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Treasury.

ACTION: Final rule; correction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: This document includes corrections to the final regulations 
(Treasury Decision 9968) published in the Federal Register on Thursday, 
October 13, 2022. This correction contains final regulations under 
section 36B of the Internal Revenue Code (Code) that amend the 
regulations regarding eligibility for the premium tax credit (PTC) to 
provide that affordability of employer-sponsored minimum essential 
coverage (employer coverage) for family members of an employee is 
determined based on the employee's share of the cost of covering the 
employee and those family members, not the cost of covering only the 
employee.

DATES: These corrections are effective on December 12, 2022.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Clara Raymond at (202) 317-4718 (not a 
toll-free number).
