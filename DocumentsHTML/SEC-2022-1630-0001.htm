SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Part 200

[Release No. 33-11139; 34-96508; IA-6203; IC-34774]


Technical Amendments to Commission Rules

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: To conform with current Federal Register requirements of 
structuring statutory authority citations within the Code of Federal 
Regulations (``CFR''), the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(``Commission'') is adopting technical amendments to its regulations 
regarding organization; conduct and ethics; and information and 
requests. The technical amendments move the citations of statutory 
authority for the regulations from the subpart level to the part level 
and amend related citations to remove duplicative statutory citations 
at the subpart level<INF>.</INF>

DATES: Effective: December 21, 2022.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: J. Matthew DeLesDernier, Deputy 
Secretary, Office of the Secretary, (202) 551-5400, Securities and 
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: To conform with current Federal Register 
requirements for structuring statutory authority citations within the 
CFR, the Commission is making technical changes to Commission rules to 
provide enhanced clarity regarding citations of statutory authority for 
part 200 of 17 CFR (``part 200'') and its subparts.\1\ Specifically, 
the Commission is moving the citations of statutory authority contained 
in subparts of 17 CFR part 200 to appear directly under 17 CFR part 
200. Currently, the citations of statutory authority for part 200 are 
provided at the subpart level. The technical amendments move these 
citations of statutory authority from the subpart level to the part 
level. In connection with these changes, the Commission is amending the 
citations to statutory authority for the subparts of part 200 to: (1) 
remove duplication in the citations of statutory authority resulting 
from this change; and (2) update citation formats to match current 
Federal Register standards.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ See 17 CFR 200.1 through 200.800.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I. Administrative Law Matters

    The Commission finds, in accordance with the Administrative 
Procedure Act (``APA''), that these amendments relate solely to agency 
organization, procedure, or practice.\2\ Accordingly, the APA's 
provisions regarding notice of rulemaking and opportunity for public 
comment are not applicable. These changes are therefore effective on 
December 21, 2022. In accordance with the APA, we find that there is 
good cause to establish an effective date less than 30 days after 
publication of these amendments.\3\ These amendments do not 
substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency parties 
and pertain to clarifying the authority of internal Commission 
operations. For the same reasons, the provisions of the Small Business 
Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act are not applicable.\4\

[[Page 77983]]

Additionally, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,\5\ 
which apply only when notice and comment are required by the APA or 
other law, are not applicable.\6\ These amendments do not contain any 
collection of information requirements as defined by the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995.\7\ Further, because these amendments impose no 
new burdens on private parties, the Commission does not believe that 
the amendments will have any impact on competition for purposes of 
section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act.\8\

    \2\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A).
    \3\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d).
    \4\ See 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C) (the term ``rule'' does not include 
``any rule of agency organization, procedure, or practice that does 
not substantially affect the rights or obligations of non-agency 
parties'').
    \5\ 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.

forth in section 19(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 [15 U.S.C. 77s],
