Sec.  1.1061-3  Exceptions to the definition of an API.

* * * * *
    (c) * * *
    (3) * * *
    (v) * * *
    (A) * * * For purposes of the Section 1061 Regulations, an 
allocation is not a Capital Interest Allocation to the extent the 
allocation is attributable to the contribution of an amount of capital 
to a partnership that, directly or indirectly, results from, or is 
attributable to, any loan or other advance made or guaranteed, directly 
or indirectly, by the partnership or another partner in the partnership 
(or any Related Person with respect to such persons), except to the 
extent a loan or advance is described in paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B) of this 
section.* * *
    (B) * * * Paragraph (c)(3)(v)(A) of this section does not apply 
with respect to an allocation attributable to a contribution made by an 
individual service provider that, directly or indirectly, results from, 
or is attributable to, a loan or advance from another partner in the 
partnership (or any Related Person with respect to such other partner, 
other than the partnership) to such individual service provider if the 
individual service provider is personally liable for the repayment of 
such loan or advance. A contribution made by an individual service 
provider includes a contribution made by an entity that is wholly owned 
by, and disregarded as separate from, the individual service provider 
as described in Sec.  1.1061-2(a)(1)(v), including a contribution 
attributable to a loan or advance made to the disregarded entity by 
another partner in the partnership (or any Related Person with respect 
to such other partner, other than the partnership) if the individual 
service provider is personally liable for the repayment of any and all 
borrowed amounts that are not repaid by the disregarded entity. For 
purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(v)(B), an individual service provider 
is personally liable for the repayment of a loan or advance made by 
another partner (or any Related Person with respect to such other 
partner, other than the partnership) if--

which the target partnership directly or indirectly holds an interest.

    (B) Determination that the Lookthrough Rule applies to the 
disposition of a Passthrough Interest. Paragraph (b)(9)(i)(A) of this 
section similarly applies with respect to a Passthrough Interest issued 
by an S corporation or a PFIC to the extent that the Passthrough

combined net API One Year Distributive Share Amount of $700) plus A's 
$200 API One Year Disposition Amount.
* * * * *

0
Par. 5. Section 1.1061-5 is amended by:
0
1. Removing the language ``of this section'' in the fourth sentence of 
paragraph (f)(1) and adding the language ``of this section;'' in its 
place.
0
2. Revising paragraphs (f)(2)(i) and (ii) and (f)(3).
    The revisions read as follows:


Sec.  1.1061-5  Section 1061(d) transfers to related persons.

* * * * *
    (f) * * *
    (2) * * *
    (i) Facts. A, B, and C are equal partners in GP, a partnership. GP 
holds only one asset, an API in PRS1 which is an Indirect API as to 
each of A, B, and C. Each of A, B, and C provides services in the ATB 
in connection with which GP was transferred its API in PRS1. A and B 
contribute their interests in GP to PRS2 in a section 721(a) exchange 
for interests in PRS2.
    (ii) Application of section 1061(d). Because the contribution by 
each of A and B of its interest in GP to PRS2 is an exchange in which 
no gain is recognized

[[Page 50526]]

by either A or B, the contribution is not a transfer as described in 
paragraph (b) of this section; thus section 1061(d) does not apply to 
A's and B's contribution. However, the API remains an API in the hands 
of PRS2 under Sec.  1.1061-2(a)(1)(i).
    (3) Example 3: Transfer of an API to a Section 1061(d) Related 
Person. A has held an API in GP, a partnership, for four years. A 
transfers the API to a Section 1061(d) Related Person described in 
paragraph (e) of this section in exchange for $100 of cash, resulting 
in A recognizing long-term capital gain of $100. Because this is a 
transfer described in paragraph (b) of this section, section 1061(d) 
applies to the transfer of A's API and A must determine its Section 
1061(d) Recharacterization Amount under paragraph (c) of this section. 
If, immediately prior to A's transfer of the API, the partnership had 
sold all of its assets in a fully taxable transaction for cash equal to 
the fair market value of the assets, A's share of the net long-term 
capital gain (excluding amounts not taken into account for purposes of 
section 1061 under Sec.  1.1061-4(b)(7)) from assets held for three 
years or less would have been $120. Thus, A's Section 1061(d) 
Recharacterization Amount is $120. As a result, A's $100 long-term 
capital gain is recharacterized as short-term capital gain under 
paragraph (a) of this section. The API remains an API in the hands of 
the Section 1061(d) Related Person under Sec.  1.1061-2(a)(1)(i).
* * * * *


Sec.  1.1061-6  [Amended]

0
Par. 6. Section 1.1061-6 is amended by removing the language ``capital 
gain excluding'' in the first sentence of paragraph (c)(1)(i) and

Sec.  1.1223-3  [Amended]

0
Par. 7. Section 1.1223-3 is amended by removing the language ``June 30, 
2020'' in the third sentence of paragraph (f)(10) and adding the
