I. Discussion

    On June 2, 2022, the Commission adopted rule and form amendments to 
mandate the electronic filing on EDGAR \1\ of Forms 144 \2\ reporting 
the sale of securities of issuers subject to the reporting requirements 
of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act \3\ (``reporting 
issuers'').\4\ The Electronic Filing Release provides that the 
requirement to file Form 144 electronically regarding reporting issuers 
will begin six months after the date of publication in the Federal 
Register of the Commission release that adopts the version of the EDGAR 
Filer Manual addressing updates to Form 144. The Commission adopted 
that version of the EDGAR Filer Manual on September 19, 2022, and the 
Federal Register published it on October 13, 2022.\5\ Accordingly, the 
Commission issued an announcement stating that the electronic filing 
requirement will begin on April 13, 2023.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ The Commission receives filings through its Electronic Data 
Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (``EDGAR'') system.
    \2\ Form 144 is referenced in 17 CFR 239.144. Pursuant to 17 CFR 
230.144(h) (``Rule 144(h)'' under the Securities Act), an affiliate 
who intends to resell restricted or control securities of the issuer 
in reliance upon 17 CFR 230.144 (``Rule 144'' under the Securities 
Act) during any three-month period in a transaction that exceeds 
either 5,000 shares or has an aggregate sales price of more than 
$50,000 must file a Form 144 concurrently with either the placing of 
an order with a broker to execute the sale or the execution of a 
sale directly with a market maker.
    \3\ 15 U.S.C. 78m or 78(o)(d), respectively. Specifically, 17 
CFR 230.144(h)(1) (``Rule 144(h)(1)'' under the Securities Act) 
requires electronic filing on EDGAR of Forms 144 reporting the sale 
of securities of issuers that are, and have been for at least 90 
days immediately before the sale, subject to the reporting 
requirements of section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
    \4\ See Updating EDGAR Filing Requirements and Form 144 Filings, 
Release No. 33-11070 (Jun. 2, 2022) [87 FR 35393 (Jun. 10, 2022)] 
(``Electronic Filing Release''). The Electronic Filing Release 
removed and reserved then 17 CFR 232.101(b)(4) (then ``Rule 
101(b)(4)'' of Regulation S-T), which permitted electronic filing of 
Form 144 regarding reporting issuers and added 17 CFR 
232.101(a)(1)(xxvii) (``Rule 101(a)(1)(xxvii)''), which will require 
it. The Electronic Filing Release also adopted conforming amendments 
and amendments to mandate the electronic filing or submission of 
other documents.
    \5\ See Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual, Release No. 33-
11101 (Sept. 19, 2022) [87 FR 61977 (Oct. 13, 2022)] (``EDGAR Filer 
Manual Release''). The updates to Form 144 included making a 
fillable Form 144 available on the EDGAR Online Forms website for 
electronic filing on EDGAR.
    \6\ See Form 144 Electronic Filing Compliance Date is April 13, 
2023 (modified Oct. 18, 2022) available at https://www.sec.gov/oit/
announcement/form-144-electronic-filing-compliance-
date#:~:text=Announcement%20Form%20144%20electronic%20filing%20compli
ance%20date%20is,from%20paper%20to%20electronic%20filing%20of%20Form%
20144.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under current rules, a Form 144 submitted by direct transmission 
after 5:30 p.m. is deemed filed the next business day.\7\ Section 17 
CFR 232.13(a)(2) (``Rule 13(a)(2)'' of Regulation S-T) provides that, 
subject to specified exceptions, a filing that meets stated basic 
requirements, submitted by direct transmission:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \7\ All references in this release to submission times and dates 
are to Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving Time, 
whichever is currently in effect, on weekdays that are not federal 
holidays (``business days'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> No later than 5:30 p.m., will be deemed filed on the same 
business day; and
    <bullet> After 5:30 p.m., will be deemed filed the next business 
day.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ Rule 13(a)(2) expressly refers to direct transmissions 
``commencing'' at these times. A direct transmission typically takes 
milliseconds to complete. Consequently, as a practical matter, a 
direct transmission begins and ends at the same time. As a result, 
for simplicity, this release generally omits reference to when a 
direct transmission begins or ends.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Title 17 CFR 232.13(a)(4) (``Rule 13(a)(4)'') provides that, 
notwithstanding Rule 13(a)(2), a Form 3, 4, or 5 \9\ or Schedule 14N 
\10\ submitted by direct transmission on or before 10:00 p.m. will be 
deemed filed on the same business day.\11\ When the Commission mandated 
electronic filing of Forms 3, 4, and 5 in 2003, it stated that its 
``objective . . . is to create a system that insiders can use 
relatively easily themselves'' and ``agree[d with commenters] that 
extended filing hours would ease filers' administrative burdens, 
without impairing prompt public availability of the filed 
information.'' \12\ Similarly, when the Commission adopted Schedule 14N 
in 2010, it cited administrative considerations and added Schedule 14N 
to the list of filing types with extended filing hours in Rule 
13(a)(4).\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \9\ 17 CFR 249.103, 249.104, and 249.105, respectively. In 
general, a reporting company's officers, directors and principal 
shareholders subject to section 16 of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 
78p), must file Forms 3, 4, and 5 to report beneficial ownership of 
and transactions in the company's securities.
    \10\ 17 CFR 240.14n-101. Generally, a shareholder or group of 
shareholders that submits a nominee or nominees for inclusion in a 
reporting company's proxy materials under the circumstances 17 CFR 
240.14n-1 specifies, must file a Schedule 14N with the Commission 
and, simultaneously, provide it to the company.
    \11\ In 2022, the Commission proposed amending Rule 13(a)(4) to 
add references to 17 CFR 240.13d-101 and 240.13d-102 (Schedules 13D 
and 13G, respectively) in connection with its proposal to accelerate 
their filing deadlines. See Modernization of Beneficial Ownership 
Reporting, Release No. 33-11030 (Feb. 10, 2022) [87 FR 13846 (Mar. 
10, 2022)]. Citing the proposed deadlines, the Commission stated 
that it anticipated that the proposed amendment to Rule 13(a)(4) 
``would ease filers' administrative burdens.'' Id. We are taking no 
action in regard to these proposals at this time.
    \12\ See Mandated Electronic Filing and website Posting for 
Forms 3, 4 and 5, Release No. 33-8230 (May 7, 2003) [68 FR 25788 
(May 13, 2003)]. Also in regard to easing administrative burden, the 
Commission noted in this release that it had made available ``a new 
on-line filing system [accessible through the Commission's website] 
to make it easier to [electronically] file Forms 3, 4 and 5.'' Id.
    \13\ See Facilitating Shareholder Director Nominations, Release 
No. 33-9136 (Aug. 25 2010) [75 FR 56668 (Sept. 16, 2010)] (The 
Commission adopted an amendment to Rule 13(a)(4) to add a reference 
to Schedule 14N ``to allow nominating shareholders additional time 
to file the . . . Schedule 14N and transmit [it] to the company.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Commission is similarly sensitive to the effort required to 
electronically file a Form 144.\14\ Accordingly, the Commission noted 
in the Electronic Filing Release that Form 144 filers will benefit from 
``planned changes to make [Form 144] an online fillable document that 
would facilitate electronic filing''.\15\

[[Page 12207]]

In a further effort to facilitate electronic filing of Form 144, we are 
now amending Rule 13(a)(4) to include Form 144.\16\ As a result, upon 
effectiveness of these amendments, a Form 144 that otherwise complies 
with applicable filing requirements that is submitted by direct 
transmission after 5:30 p.m., but no later than 10:00 p.m., will be 
deemed filed the same business day.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \14\ In this regard, we note that, similar to Forms 3, 4, and 5 
and Schedule 14N, the obligation to file a Form 144 may be incurred 
by a natural person.
    \15\ See Electronic Filing Release (``An online fillable form 
will enable the convenient input of information, and support the 
electronic assembly of such information and transmission to EDGAR, 
without requiring a Form 144 filer to purchase or maintain 
additional software or technology. The fillable form will be similar 
to other fillable forms that are currently available to file other 
Form-specific . . . filings . . . such as Forms . . . 3, 4, and 
5.''). An online fillable Form 144 is now available. See the EDGAR 
Filer Manual Release.
    \16\ To make the language within Rule 13(a) more consistent, we 
also are amending Rule 13(a)(4) by adding ``commencing'' between 
``transmission'' and ``on'' in the current phrase ``submitted by 
direction transmission on or before 10 p.m.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EDGAR will be updated to include Forms 144 and 144/A \17\ among the 
submission types that EDGAR will accept and disseminate on the same day 
if the submissions are made from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. We expect 
these updates to be completed on or about March 20, 2023, and disclosed 
in the Commission release that adopts the version of the EDGAR Filer 
Manual addressing the extended filing hours for Form 144.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ We use the term ``144/A'' in this context to refer to an 
amended Form 144.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition to amending the Form 144 filing deadline, we are making 
two technical amendments. First, we are amending three provisions to 
correct errors about the time period during which filings made by 
direct submission may be submitted to the Commission. In particular, we 
are correcting errors in 17 CFR 230.110(c) (``Rule 110'' under the 
Securities Act), 240.0-2(c) (``Rule 0-2(c)'' under the Exchange Act), 
and 260.0-5(c) (``Rule 0-5(c)'' under the Trust Indenture Act) by 
conforming them to 17 CFR 232.12(c) (``Rule 12(c)'' of Regulation S-T) 
and Section 2.3.1 of the EDGAR Filer Manual.\18\ Rules 110(c), 0-2(c), 
and 0-5(c) currently provide that filings made by direct transmission 
may be submitted to the Commission each business day, from ``8 a.m. to 
10 p.m.'' In fact, filings may be submitted starting at 6 a.m. 
Consequently, we are revising Rules 110(c), 0-2(c), and 0-5(c) to 
replace ``8 a.m.'' with ``6 a.m.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ To make the language within Rule 12 more consistent, we 
also are amending Rule 12(c) by replacing the term ``Eastern Time'' 
with the term ``Eastern Standard Time or Eastern Daylight Saving 
Time, whichever is currently in effect.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, we are reinstating the Regulation S-T-based requirement for 
paper filings of Form 144 for non-reporting issuers that was 
inadvertently removed in the Electronic Filing Release.\19\ Before the 
Commission issued the Electronic Filing Release, then 17 CFR 
232.101(c)(6) (``Rule 101(c)(6)'' of Regulation S-T) provided that a 
filer must file in paper ``[f]ilings on Form 144 . . . where the issuer 
is [a non-reporting issuer].'' The preamble of the Electronic Filing 
Release noted that the Commission was not adopting an earlier proposal 
to eliminate the Form 144 filing requirement in regard to non-reporting 
issuers \20\ and ``[a]s such affiliates relying on Rule 144 [in regard 
to a non-reporting issuer] will still be required to file a notice of 
sale on Form 144 in paper form pursuant to Rule 101(c)(6) of Regulation 
S-T and Rule 144.'' The regulatory text section of the Electronic 
Filing Release, however, inadvertently removed and reserved Rule 
101(c)(6). Consequently, we are reinstating it in this release to 
correct this inadvertent omission.\21\ In addition, the regulatory text 
section of the Electronic Filing Release amended 17 CFR 239.144 to 
provide for electronic filing of Form 144 and inadvertently failed to 
provide for the continued paper filing for non-reporting issuers. 
Accordingly, we are amending paragraph (a) of 17 CFR 239.144 to clarify 
that Form 144 must be filed electronically in regard to reporting 
issuers and in paper in regard to non-reporting issuers.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ Reinstating the Regulation S-T based-requirement is also 
consistent with the Electronic Filing Release adding Rule 144(h)(2), 
which requires three copies of Form 144 for non-reporting issuers.
    \20\ See Rule 144 Holding Period and Form 144 Filings, Release 
No. 33-10911 (Dec. 23, 2020) [86 FR 5063 (Jan. 19, 2021)] 
(proposing, among other actions, eliminating the requirement to file 
Form 144 regarding a non-reporting issuer).
    \21\ Relatedly, we are conforming Rule 101(a)(1)(xxvii) to Rule 
144(h)(1) by adding a reference to issuers that have been reporting 
companies for at least 90 days before the sale.
    \22\ As described in the Electronic Filing Release, in April 
2020, in recognition of several logistical difficulties related to 
the submission of Form 144 in paper pursuant to then Rule 101(b)(4) 
and (c)(6), as well as ongoing health and safety concerns related to 
COVID-19, the Division of Corporation Finance issued a statement 
announcing a temporary no-action position that it would not 
recommend enforcement action to the Commission if Forms 144 for the 
period from and including April 10, 2020 to June 30, 2020 were 
submitted as a complete PDF attachment and emailed to the Commission 
in lieu of filing the form in paper. As also described in the 
Electronic Filing release, subsequently, on June 25, 2020, the 
Division of Corporation Finance indefinitely extended this statement 
from the period beginning on April 10, 2020. See Division of 
Corporation Finance Statement Regarding Requirements for Form 144 
Paper Filings in Light of COVID-19 Concerns, U.S. Sec. & Exch. 
Comm'n (June 25, 2020), available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/announcement/form-144-paper-filings-email-option-update">https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/announcement/form-144-paper-filings-email-option-update</a>. The 
Electronic Filing Release went on to note that the 2020 statement 
would be withdrawn upon the compliance date of amended Rules 
144(h)(2) and 101(a)(1)(xxvii), later established as April 13, 2023, 
because ``it [was] no longer necessary due to the rule amendments.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

II. Procedural and Other Matters

    The Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') generally requires an 
agency to publish notice of a rulemaking in the Federal Register and 
provide an opportunity for public comment.\23\ This requirement does 
not apply, however, to rules of agency organization, procedure, or 
practice,\24\ or if the agency ``for good cause finds . . . that notice 
and public procedure thereon are impracticable, unnecessary, or 
contrary to the public interest.'' \25\ We find that these amendments 
relate to agency procedures or practice and do not substantially alter 
the rights and obligations of non-agency parties. We also find that 
notice and comment are unnecessary because the amendments merely (i) 
extend from 5:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. the latest time by which a Form 144 
submitted by direct transmission is deemed filed the same business day; 
and (ii) make technical corrections. It follows that the amendments do 
not require analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act or a Report 
to Congress under the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness 
Act.\26\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (c).
    \24\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A).
    \25\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).
    \26\ See 5 U.S.C. 601(2) (for purposes of a Regulatory 
Flexibility Act analysis, the term ``rule'' means any rule for which 
the agency publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking) and 5 
U.S.C. 804(3)(C) (for purposes of Congressional review of agency 
rulemaking, the term ``rule'' does not include any rule of agency 
organization, procedure, or practice that does not substantially 
alter the rights or obligations of non-agency parties).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The APA generally requires that an agency publish an adopted rule 
in the Federal Register at least 30 days before it becomes 
effective.\27\ This requirement, however, does not apply if the agency 
finds good cause for making the rule effective sooner.\28\ For the same 
reasons as we are forgoing notice and comment, we find good cause to 
make these amendments effective on March 20, 2023. We believe that as 
soon as practicable (i) electronic filers should be able to submit a 
direct transmission of a Form 144 as late as 10:00 p.m. and have it 
deemed filed the same business day; and (ii) technical corrections 
should be in place. We therefore find there is good cause for these 
amendments to take effect on March 20, 2023. We also believe that the 
amendments regarding the submission timing for Form 144 relieve a 
restriction on an electronic filer by providing more time for a direct 
transmission of a Form

[[Page 12208]]

144 to be deemed filed the same business day.\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
    \28\ Id.
    \29\ See 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If any of the provisions of these rules, or the application thereof 
to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, such invalidity 
shall not affect other provisions or application of such provisions to 
other persons or circumstances that can be given effect without the 
invalid provision or application.

III. Paperwork Reduction Act

    Certain provisions of our rules and forms contain ``collection of 
information'' requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 (``PRA'').\30\ An agency may not conduct or 
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of 
information requirement unless it displays a currently valid Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) control number. Compliance with the 
information collections is mandatory. Responses to the information 
collections are not kept confidential and there is no mandatory 
retention period for the information disclosed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \30\ 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, the amendments do not substantively alter the Form 
144 (OMB Control Number 3235-0328) electronic filing requirements, but 
rather merely (i) extend from 5:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. the latest time 
by which a filer can submit a direct transmission of a Form 144 to have 
it be deemed filed the same business day; and (ii) make technical 
corrections. This change in timing does not change the information 
collection burden and therefore we are not revising any burden and cost 
estimates in connection with these amendments.

IV. Economic Analysis

    We are mindful of the costs imposed by, and the benefits to be 
obtained from, our rules. Section 2(b) of the Securities Act \31\ and 
section 3(f) of the Exchange Act \32\ require the Commission, whenever 
it engages in rulemaking and is required to consider or determine 
whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, 
to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the 
action would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 
Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act \33\ also requires the Commission 
to consider the impact that the rules would have on competition and 
prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a 
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of 
the Exchange Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ 15 U.S.C. 77b(b).
    \32\ 15 U.S.C. 78c(f).
    \33\ 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    On June 2, 2022, the Commission adopted rule and form amendments to 
mandate the electronic filing on EDGAR of Form 144 in regard to the 
sale of securities of reporting issuers.\34\ To further facilitate 
electronic filing of Form 144, we are now adopting amendments that 
will--in addition to making certain technical corrections \35\--deem a 
Form 144 that is submitted by direct transmission after 5:30 p.m. but 
not later than 10:00 p.m. to be filed the same business day, rather 
than on the following business day (``same-day filing amendment''). The 
same-day filing amendment will apply to all electronic filings of Form 
144,\36\ though many of these filings may be submitted on or before 
5:30 p.m. on the filing date. Although we believe the impact of the 
same-day filing amendment on Form 144 is likely to be marginal, we 
expect that this amendment will result in some benefits to market 
participants, including Form 144 filers and those who use information 
disclosed in Form 144, without imposing substantial costs. In addition, 
we do not expect any significant changes to efficiency, competition, or 
capital formation as a result of the extended hours for same-day filing 
treatment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ See generally Electronic Filing Release.
    \35\ Because of the limited nature of the technical amendments, 
see supra Section I, we do not expect them to have significant 
economic effects.
    \36\ In 2021, the Commission received approximately 30,000 Form 
144 filings, of which approximately 99% (or 29,700) were in regard 
to the sale of securities of reporting issuers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We believe that the same-day filing amendment will provide some 
benefits to market participants. Extending the filing hours to 10:00 
p.m. could benefit those involved with the filing process as they will 
gain extra time to prepare and submit filings, without impacting the 
filing date. The Commission stated in the Electronic Filing Release its 
understanding that most filers prepare and file Form 144 individually 
or with assistance of a broker or personal counsel.\37\ The extended 
filing hours could also limit these filing process participants' need 
to outsource the filing process to other parties, which may add costs 
to the filing process. Additionally, extending the filing hours could 
improve the quality of filings by reducing the need to rush to complete 
them. The likely improved quality of filings could benefit those who 
use the information disclosed in Form 144.

    \37\ See Electronic Filing Release, n.74 (citing letter from 
Jesse Brill (Dec. 18, 2013), available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-671.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/rules/petitions/2013/petn4-671.pdf</a>; letter from Securities Industry and 
Financial Markets Association (Mar. 22, 2021), available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-24-20/s72420-8530175-230264.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-24-20/s72420-8530175-230264.pdf</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We also do not believe that the same-day filing amendment will 
impose substantial costs on market participants that use the 
information disclosed in the forms. As discussed in the Electronic 
Filing Release,\38\ a benefit of electronic filings is faster and more 
efficient access to the filed documents, which facilitates the flow of 
information to market participants from affiliates of reporting 
issuers. Allowing filers more time to file (four and a half hours 
longer) each day might create some delay in some market participants' 
access to these documents. However, we do not expect this extension 
will reduce these benefits significantly. First, this extension extends 
the filing deadline only from 5:30 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Not all of the 
filers are likely to take the option to file after 5:30 p.m. Second, to 
the extent that filers take advantage of the extended filing hours, we 
do not believe that the delay in access to the filed documents will 
lead to a loss in information or significant reduction in the value of 
the information for investors because the extension of the filing 
deadline to 10:00 p.m. at the latest, still allows investors to review 
the filings well before the stock exchanges open the next day. We do 
not believe investors who may use the information from these filings to 
trade will be negatively affected by the delay. In fact, the extra time 
might provide filers with opportunities to check their filings 
carefully, thus improving the accuracy of the submitted information.

to find and review [an EDGAR] filing more quickly, as a result of 
the amendments, than they are able to access paper filings.'').
