SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Parts 227 and 239

[Release No. 33-10781]


Temporary Amendments to Regulation Crowdfunding

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Temporary final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is 
adopting temporary final rules to facilitate capital formation for 
small businesses impacted by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The 
temporary final rules are intended to expedite the offering process for 
smaller, previously established companies directly or indirectly 
affected by COVID-19 that are seeking to meet their funding needs 
through the offer and sale of securities pursuant to Regulation 
Crowdfunding. The temporary final rules are designed to facilitate this 
offering process by providing tailored, conditional relief from certain 
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding relating to the timing of the 
offering and the availability of financial statements required to be 
included in issuers' offering materials while retaining appropriate 
investor protections.

DATES: 
    Effective date: The amendments are effective from May 4, 2020, 
through March 1, 2021.
    Applicability date: The amendments apply to securities offerings 
initiated under Regulation Crowdfunding between May 4, 2020, and August 
31, 2020.

Business Policy, Division of Corporation Finance, at (202) 551-3460; 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, 
DC 20549-3628.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are adopting amendments to 17 CFR 227.100 
(``Rule 100''), 17 CFR 227.201 (``Rule 201''), 17 CFR 227.301 (``Rule 
301''), 17 CFR 227.303 (``Rule 303'') and 17 CFR 227.304 (``Rule 304'') 
of 17 CFR part 227 (``Regulation Crowdfunding'') under 15 U.S.C. 77a et 
seq. (the ``Securities Act'') and to 17 CFR 239.900 (``Form C'') as 
temporary final rules.

I. Introduction

    The outbreak of COVID-19 has had far-reaching effects, with small 
businesses being particularly affected by the closures and safety 
measures designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.\1\ The Commission 
recognizes that, in the current environment, many small businesses are 
facing challenges accessing urgently needed capital in a timely and 
cost-effective manner. A securities offering under Regulation 
Crowdfunding may be an attractive fundraising option for some small 
businesses at this time, particularly as a means of allowing an issuer 
to make use of the internet to reach out to its customers or members of 
its local community as potential investors as well as to existing 
investors. However, based on feedback that the Commission has received 
from its Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee and other 
outreach conducted by SEC staff, the Commission understands that 
certain Regulation Crowdfunding requirements may make it difficult for 
an issuer affected by COVID-19 to launch an offering and see it to 
completion within a time frame that meets its urgent capital needs.\2\

shut temporarily within the next two weeks. Forty-three percent 
believe they have less than six months until a permanent shutdown is 
unavoidable.'').

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In light of the challenges facing small businesses, the Commission 
has determined that temporary relief from certain requirements of 
Regulation Crowdfunding is necessary and appropriate to provide issuers 
with the opportunity to access capital on an expedited basis while 
maintaining investor protections. The temporary

[[Page 27117]]

rules provide flexibility for issuers who meet certain eligibility 
criteria \3\ to assess interest in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering 
prior to preparation of full offering materials,\4\ and then once 
launched, to close such an offering and have access to funds sooner 
than would be possible in the absence of the temporary relief.\5\ The 
temporary rules also provide an exemption from certain financial 
statement review requirements for issuers offering $250,000 or less in 
reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding within a 12-month period.\6\ The 
following table summarizes the amendments:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.100(b)(7) (``Rule 100(b)(7)''). To 
rely on the temporary rules, an issuer must meet the requirements of 
temporary Rule 100(b)(7) in addition to the current eligibility 
requirements of 17 CFR 227.100(b)(1) through (6).
    \4\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.201(z)(2) (``Rule 201(z)(2)'').
    \5\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.303(g) (``Rule 303(g)'') and 
temporary 17 CFR 227.304(e) (``Rule 304(e)'').
    \6\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.201(z)(3) (``Rule 201(z)(3)''). 
Note that Instruction 1 to paragraph (t) continues to apply in 
connection with the determination of the offering amount. See supra 
Note 21.

issue other relief.

II. Eligibility Requirements for Reliance on Temporary Rules

    The temporary relief we are providing in this release will be 
available to issuers who meet certain eligibility

[[Page 27118]]

criteria. Specifically, in addition to the current eligibility 
requirements for Regulation Crowdfunding,\8\ to rely on the temporary 
rules for an offering an issuer must have been organized and have had 
operations for no less than six months prior to the commencement of 
such offering.\9\ We believe that this limitation on eligibility is 
appropriate because the temporary relief is intended primarily to 
assist existing businesses that require additional funds because of 
adverse effects caused by the closures and safety measures designed to 
slow the spread of COVID-19. In addition, limiting the relief to 
issuers that had been organized and had operations for at least six 
months prior to the offering should help mitigate risk to investors 
associated with use of the temporary accommodations by newly formed 
businesses. New businesses are not foreclosed from conducting an 
offering under Regulation Crowdfunding, but will need to comply with 
existing rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \8\ 15 U.S.C. 77d-1 (``Section 4A'') of the Securities Act 
specifically excludes non-U.S. issuers, issuers that are required to 
file reports under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934, investment companies, as defined in Section 3 of the 
Investment Company Act of 1940 or excluded from the definition of 
investment company by Section 3(b) or Section 3(c) of that Act; and 
other issuers that the Commission, by rule or regulation, determines 
appropriate. 15 U.S.C. 77d-1(f). In addition, the Commission's rules 
further exclude: Issuers that are disqualified under Regulation 
Crowdfunding's disqualification rules, issuers that have failed to 
comply with the annual reporting requirements under Regulation 
Crowdfunding during the two years immediately preceding the filing 
of the offering statement, and blank check companies. 17 CFR 
227.100(b). These eligibility requirements remain unchanged under 
the temporary relief.
    \9\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.100(b)(7)(i). Because of the wide 
variety in the types of businesses that may rely on Regulation 
Crowdfunding, the activities that constitute operations and the 
level of operations will vary from issuer to issuer. Examples of 
issuers who would be considered to have operations include but are 
not limited to those that: Have assets, revenue, operating expenses 
(such as rent, salaries, or utilities), or interest expense; have 
paid taxes or incurred business debt; or have previously filed a 
Form C for a Regulation Crowdfunding offering.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, an issuer will be ineligible to rely on the temporary 
rules for an offering if the issuer has previously sold securities 
under Regulation Crowdfunding and, in connection with such prior 
offering(s), did not comply with the requirements in 15 U.S.C. 77d-1(b) 
(``Section 4A(b)'') of the Securities Act and the related requirements 
of Regulation Crowdfunding.\10\ This limitation will prevent an issuer 
with a history of non-compliance in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings 
from taking advantage of the temporary exemptions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \10\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.100(b)(7)(ii). An issuer must meet 
the eligibility criteria at the time it initiates an offering in 
reliance on the temporary rules. Therefore, an issuer that was 
delinquent in its filing obligations that becomes current prior to 
initiating a new offering would be eligible to rely on the temporary 
rules. An issuer relying on the temporary relief that is 
subsequently found to be non-compliant in connection with prior 
offerings (other than insignificant deviations covered by the safe 
harbor of 17 CFR 227.502(a)) would not have been eligible for the 
temporary relief, with the result that the Regulation Crowdfunding 
exemption would not be available for the offering.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In connection with this temporary amendment, we are making a 
related amendment to Rule 301 to require that an intermediary \11\ 
involved in an offering by an issuer that is relying on the temporary 
relief must have a reasonable basis for believing that the issuer has 
complied with the requirements of Section 4A(b) and the related 
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding in prior offerings.\12\ For 
this requirement, the intermediary may reasonably rely on the 
representations of the issuer concerning compliance with these 
requirements unless the intermediary has reason to question the 
reliability of those representations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \11\ For purposes of Regulation Crowdfunding, an intermediary 
means a registered broker-dealer or funding portal. See 17 CFR 
227.300(c)(3).
    \12\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.301(d) (``Rule 301(d)'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

III. Temporary Relief From Certain Financial Information Requirements

    In order to conduct a Regulation Crowdfunding offering, an issuer 
must electronically file its offering statement on Form C with the 
Commission and provide it to the intermediary facilitating the 
crowdfunding offering prior to commencing its offering.\13\ The 
offering statement must include specified information, including a 
discussion of the issuer's financial condition and financial 
statements.\14\ The financial statement requirements are based on the 
amount offered and sold in reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding within 
the preceding 12-month period: \15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \13\ See Rule 201.
    \14\ See id.
    \15\ See 17 CFR 227.201(t) (``Rule 201(t)'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> For issuers offering $107,000 or less: Financial 
statements of the issuer and certain information from the issuer's 
Federal income tax returns, both certified by the principal executive 
officer. If, however, financial statements of the issuer are available 
that have either been reviewed or audited by a public accountant that 
is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial 
statements instead and will not need to include the information 
reported on the Federal income tax returns or the certification by the 
principal executive officer.
    <bullet> Issuers offering more than $107,000 but not more than 
$535,000: Financial statements reviewed by a public accountant that is 
independent of the issuer. If, however, financial statements of the 
issuer are available that have been audited by a public accountant that 
is independent of the issuer, the issuer must provide those financial 
statements instead and will not need to include the reviewed financial 
statements.
    <bullet> Issuers offering more than $535,000:
    [cir] For first-time Regulation Crowdfunding issuers: Financial 
statements reviewed by a public accountant that is independent of the 
issuer, unless financial statements of the issuer are available that 
have been audited by an independent auditor.
    [cir] For issuers that have previously sold securities in reliance 
on Regulation Crowdfunding: Financial statements audited by a public 
accountant that is independent of the issuer.\16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \16\ See id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In light of the challenges that small businesses are experiencing 
as a result of COVID-19, we believe that temporary, limited exemptive 
relief from certain Regulation Crowdfunding requirements for issuers 
that meet the enhanced eligibility requirements discussed above may 
help provide timely access to capital, while maintaining appropriate 
investor protections.

A. Omission of Financial Statements From Initial Form C Filing

    An issuer that seeks to conduct an offering under Regulation 
Crowdfunding to address urgent funding needs arising from or relating 
to COVID-19 but that does not have current financial statements 
available, or that is facing challenges in obtaining reviewed or 
audited financial statements due to COVID-19, may find it difficult to 
prepare the required financial statements in order to launch a timely 
offering. Further, the issuer may be more reluctant to undertake the 
cost of the preparation of such financial statements during the 
pandemic without some indication that the securities offering has a 
chance of succeeding. In light of this, we are providing temporary 
relief from certain financial information requirements in an issuer's 
initial Form C filing. The temporary relief will allow an issuer to 
provide offering information through the intermediary's platform and 
informally gauge investor interest in an offering before going through 
the effort and expense of preparing financial statements.

[[Page 27119]]

    Temporary Rule 201(z)(2) allows an issuer that meets the 
eligibility requirements described above to (i) omit the financial 
statements required by Rule 201(t) in its initial Form C filed with the 
Commission, to the extent such financial statements are not otherwise 
available; and (ii) commence its offering of securities through the 
intermediary's platform. Such financial statements are, however, 
required to be included in an amendment to the Form C and provided to 
investors and the intermediary before the intermediary accepts any 
investment commitments in the offering.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \17\ Because no investment commitments may be made until 
complete financial statements are provided, the filing of the 
amendment including such financial statements will not trigger the 
reconfirmation requirements of 17 CFR 227.304(c) (``Rule 304(c)'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An issuer relying on this temporary rule must prominently disclose 
that:
    <bullet> The financial information that has been omitted is not 
otherwise available and will be provided by an amendment to the 
offering materials;
    <bullet> The investor should review the complete set of offering 
materials, including previously omitted financial information, prior to 
making an investment decision; and
    <bullet> No investment commitments will be accepted until after 
such financial information has been provided.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \18\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.201(z)(1) (``Rule 201(z)(1)'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We believe that this clear disclosure to potential investors, along 
with the enhanced eligibility requirements and the inability of an 
intermediary to accept any investment commitment prior to an investor's 
receipt of all required information, will provide appropriate 
protections to investors involved in such offerings.

B. Increase in Offering Threshold Requiring Reviewed Financial 
Statements

    Market participants have indicated to the Commission that a 
temporary change to the offering threshold that triggers the 
requirement to include financial statements that are reviewed by a 
public accountant that is independent of the issuer could facilitate 
capital raising by issuers affected by COVID-19.\19\ In response, we 
are adopting temporary Rule 201(z)(3), that would apply to an eligible 
issuer \20\ in an offering or offerings that, together with all other 
amounts sold in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings within the preceding 
12-month period, have, in the aggregate, a target offering amount of 
more than $107,000, but not more than $250,000.\21\ Such an issuer may 
provide financial statements of the issuer and certain information from 
the issuer's Federal income tax returns, both certified by the 
principal executive officer, in accordance with 17 CFR 227.201(t)(1) 
(``Rule 201(t)(1)''), instead of the financial statements reviewed by a 
public accountant that is independent of the issuer that would 
otherwise be required by 17 CFR 227.201(t)(2) (``Rule 201(t)(2)''). 
This temporary relief would apply only if reviewed or audited financial 
statements of the issuer are not otherwise available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \19\ See supra note 2.
    \20\ See temporary Rule 100(b)(7).
    \21\ Note that Instruction 1 to paragraph (t) continues to apply 
in connection with the determination of the offering amount (``To 
determine the financial statements required under this paragraph 
(t), an issuer must aggregate amounts sold in reliance on section 
4(a)(6) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77d(a)(6)) within the 
preceding 12-month period and the offering amount in the offering 
for which disclosure is being provided. If the issuer will accept 
proceeds in excess of the target offering amount, the issuer must 
include the maximum offering amount that the issuer will accept in 
the calculation to determine the financial statements required under 
this paragraph (t).'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An issuer relying on this temporary rule would be required to 
provide prominent disclosure that financial information certified by 
the principal executive officer of the issuer has been provided instead 
of financial statements reviewed by a public accountant that is 
independent of the issuer.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \22\ See temporary 17 CFR 227.201(z)(1)(iii) (``Rule 
201(z)(1)(iii)'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are of the view that the financial statement requirements of 
Rule 201(t)(1), although less rigorous than Rule 201(t)(2), provide 
appropriate information and protection to investors in offerings up to 
the higher $250,000 threshold, when considered in conjunction with the 
prominent disclosure to investors and other conditions to an issuer's 
reliance on the temporary rule.

IV. Temporary Relief From Certain Timing Requirements for Offerings 
Under Regulation Crowdfunding

    Regulation Crowdfunding requires that the information in an 
offering statement be publicly available on the intermediary's platform 
for at least 21 days before any securities may be sold, although the 
intermediary may accept investment commitments during that time.\23\ In 
addition, Regulation Crowdfunding includes specific requirements with 
respect to cancellation of investment commitments and the ability to 
close an offering prior to the originally announced deadline once the 
target amount is met.\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \23\ See Securities Act Section 4A(a)(6); 17 CFR 227.303(a) 
(``Rule 303(a)''). See also 17 CFR 227.303(e)(3)(i) (``Rule 
303(e)(3)(i)'') and 17 CFR 227. 304(b) (``Rule 304(b)'').
    \24\ See Rule 304.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Market participants have indicated that these timing requirements, 
in light of business disruptions resulting from COVID-19, may make it 
difficult for issuers with urgent funding needs to make use of 
Regulation Crowdfunding to receive funds promptly.\25\ As a result, we 
are adopting the following temporary relief from these timing 
requirements for offerings initiated between May 4, 2020, and August 
31, 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \25\ See supra note 2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Suspension of 21-Day Requirement

    Rule 303(a) of Regulation Crowdfunding sets forth the requirements 
applicable to an intermediary with respect to the availability of 
specified issuer information to the Commission and to investors. This 
includes a requirement that the information be made publicly available 
on the intermediary's platform for a minimum of 21 days before any 
securities are sold in the offering. During this time, the intermediary 
may accept investment commitments.\26\ In addition, Rule 303(e)(3)(i) 
similarly imposes a 21-day requirement with respect to the availability 
of issuer information when a funding portal is directing a qualified 
third party to transmit funds to an issuer. Rule 304(b), as discussed 
below, also requires that an offering remain open for a minimum of 21 
days pursuant to Rule 303(a).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \26\ 17 CFR 227.303(a)(2) (``Rule 303(a)(2)'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This 21-day time period, particularly when considered alongside the 
time required for an issuer to prepare its offering materials and 
commence an offering under Regulation Crowdfunding, may diminish the 
utility of Regulation Crowdfunding for issuers with urgent capital 
needs as a result of COVID-19. Therefore, we are adopting temporary 
Rule 303(g), under which an intermediary is not required to comply with 
Rule 303(a)(2)'s 21-day requirement, but instead must make the required 
issuer information publicly available on the intermediary's platform 
before any securities are sold in the offering.\27\ The intermediary 
may accept investment commitments beginning when such information is 
made available, but only if the issuer has provided the financial 
information

[[Page 27120]]

required by Rule 201(t).\28\ Similarly, a funding portal is not 
required to comply with the 21-day requirement in Rule 303(e)(3)(i) 
with respect to directing a transmission of funds after a sale has 
occurred and the cancellation period has elapsed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \27\ Notwithstanding the waiver of the 21-day requirement, we 
note that no offering under these temporary rules will be able to 
close within the first 48 hours, as a result of the right to 
cancellation described in Section IV.B.
    \28\ An issuer relying on the temporary relief from the 
requirement to have financial statements be reviewed by a public 
accountant, will be deemed to have provided the financial 
information required by Rule 201(t). See Section III.B and temporary 
Rule 201(z)(3). However, an issuer that has omitted financial 
statements pursuant to temporary Rule 201(z)(2) will not be able to 
accept investment commitments until it includes such financial 
statements. See Section III.A.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    An issuer may not rely on the temporary rules unless it meets the 
temporary eligibility requirements and provides prominent disclosure 
that the offering is being conducted on an expedited basis due to 
circumstances relating to COVID-19 and pursuant to this temporary 
relief.
    While the Commission continues to believe that the 21-day time 
period provides important investor protections by helping to ensure 
that an investor has an adequate opportunity to evaluate an investment 
opportunity,\29\ we believe the prominent disclosure required by the 
temporary rules will make clear to potential investors that there may 
be a compressed time frame for the offering, and allow them to take 
that information into consideration when determining whether or not to 
invest. For instance, the disclosure will put investors on notice that 
they may have a shortened time frame within which to consider 
information about the type of offering the issuer is conducting.\30\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \29\ See Crowdfunding, Release No. 33-9974 (Oct. 30, 2015) [80 
FR 71387 (Nov. 16, 2015)] at 71442.
    \30\ SEC staff previously published an investor bulletin that 
discusses the differences between certain types of securities that 
may be offered. See SEC Office of Investor Education and Advocacy, 
Investor Bulletin: Be Cautious of SAFEs in Crowdfunding (May 9, 
2017), available at <a href="https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_safes">https://www.sec.gov/oiea/investor-alerts-and-bulletins/ib_safes</a>.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Changes to Cancellation Process

    Section 4A(b)(1)(G) of the Securities Act requires an issuer, prior 
to sale, to provide investors ``a reasonable opportunity to rescind the 
commitment to purchase the securities.'' Rule 304(a) of Regulation 
Crowdfunding gives investors an unconditional right to cancel an 
investment commitment for any reason until 48 hours prior to the 
deadline identified in the issuer's offering materials. Thereafter, an 
investor is not able to cancel any investment commitments made within 
the final 48 hours of the offering (except in the event of a material 
change to the offering).
    Rule 304(b) provides that if an issuer reaches the target offering 
amount prior to the deadline identified in its offering materials, it 
may close the offering once the target offering amount is reached, 
provided that: (1) The offering remains open for a minimum of 21 days; 
(2) the intermediary provides notice about the new offering deadline at 
least five business days prior to the new offering deadline; (3) 
investors are given the opportunity to reconsider their investment 
decision and to cancel their investment commitment until 48 hours prior 
to the new offering deadline; and (4) at the time of the new offering 
deadline, the issuer continues to meet or exceed the target offering 
amount.
    These requirements relating to an investor's ability to cancel an 
investment commitment and an issuer's ability to close an offering once 
the target offering amount has been met provide protections to 
investors by enabling them to reconsider investment decisions with the 
benefit of the views of the crowd or other information that may come to 
light during the offering period. However, these requirements may, like 
the 21-day requirement, diminish the utility of Regulation Crowdfunding 
for issuers with urgent capital needs as a result of COVID-19.
    To facilitate the use of Regulation Crowdfunding to address urgent 
funding needs, we are adopting temporary Rule 304(e) and a related 
disclosure requirement in temporary Rule 201(z)(1)(iv). These rules 
would permit an investor in an offering conducted under the temporary 
rules to cancel an investment commitment for any reason within 48 hours 
from the time of his or her investment commitment (or such later period 
as the issuer may designate).\31\ After such 48-hour period, an 
investment commitment may be cancelled only if there is a material 
change to the terms of an offering or to the information provided by 
the issuer, as provided in Rule 304(c). In addition, once an issuer has 
received binding investment commitments (that is, investment 
commitments for which the 48-hour cancellation period has run) that 
equal or exceed the target offering amount, the issuer may close the 
offering on a date earlier than the deadline identified in its offering 
materials.\32\ In order to do so, the issuer must comply with 
additional disclosure requirements described below and the intermediary 
must provide notice that the target offering amount has been met. The 
intermediary is not required to provide five business days' notice of 
the earlier closing deadline, as would normally be required under Rule 
304(b). At the time of the closing of the offering, the issuer must 
continue to have binding investment commitments that meet or exceed the 
target offering amount.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \31\ Under Rule 303(d), an intermediary must promptly, upon 
receipt of an investment commitment from an investor, give or send 
to the investor a notification disclosing certain information, 
including the date and time by which the investor may cancel the 
investment commitment.
    \32\ As is currently the case, an issuer that decides to do a 
``min/max'' offering in which offered securities will be sold if a 
minimum is met, but subject to a cap on the overall amount sold, may 
engage in a ``rolling close'' in which, once a specified minimum 
threshold is met, investors are notified by the intermediary that 
that minimum portion of the issue will be closed and funds are 
released to the issuer. After this initial close, the issuer may 
make additional closes until the maximum offering amount is 
received.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We believe that it is appropriate to provide temporary relief from 
these requirements so that issuers can more readily raise capital to 
meet their urgent funding needs, while providing protections in the 
form of prominent, clear disclosure to investors of the changes in the 
process and preserving the rules that permit cancellations when there 
has been a material change in the offering.
    The temporary rule requires the issuer to provide a prominent 
description of the process to complete the transaction or cancel an 
investment commitment, including a statement that:
    <bullet> Investors may cancel an investment commitment for any 
reason within 48 hours from the time of their investment commitment (or 
such later period as the issuer may designate);
    <bullet> The intermediary will notify investors when the target 
offering amount has been met;

[[Page 27121]]

    <bullet> The issuer may close the offering at any time after it has 
aggregate investment commitments for which the 48-hour right to cancel 
(or such later period as the issuer may designate) has elapsed that 
equal or exceed the target offering amount (absent a material change 
that would require an extension of the offering and reconfirmation of 
the investment commitment); \33\ and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \33\ If there is a material change to the terms of the offering 
or to the information provided by the issuer that would require an 
extension of the offering and reconfirmation of the investment 
commitment, the intermediary must give or send to any investor who 
has made an investment commitment notice of the material change and 
that the investor's investment commitment will be cancelled unless 
the investor reconfirms his or her investment commitment within five 
business days of receipt of the notice, in accordance with Rule 
304(c). An investor that reconfirms his or her investment commitment 
will have 48 hours to cancel such reconfirmed investment commitment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    <bullet> If an investor does not cancel an investment commitment 
within 48 hours from the time of the binding investment commitment, the 
funds will be released to the issuer upon closing of the offering and 
the investor will receive securities in exchange for his or her 
investment.

V. Disclosure of Reliance on Temporary Relief

    As described above, a condition to each aspect of the temporary 
relief we are adopting is clear disclosure to investors with respect to 
the issuer's reliance on such relief. We believe this disclosure is 
necessary to inform investors of the fact that the mechanics of the 
offering are different than the investors may be expecting, as well as 
to ensure that investors are aware that that the issuer is being 
affected by COVID-19.
    To assist issuers with compliance with these requirements, the 
following table summarizes the disclosure requirements. Where 
applicable, prominent disclosure of each of the following is required: 
\34\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \34\ We are temporarily amending the introductory paragraphs to 
the section of Form C entitled ``Optional Question & Answer Format 
for an Offering Statement'' by adding a new paragraph reminding 
issuers that are relying on these temporary rules to review and 
tailor their responses to certain questions in the Form C 
appropriately.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

VI. Economic Analysis

A. Broad Economic Considerations, Baseline, and Affected Parties

    As discussed above, in light of the considerable challenges facing 
small businesses, the Commission is providing temporary relief from 
certain requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding to issuers seeking 
funding on an expedited basis due to circumstances relating to COVID-
19. We are mindful of the costs and benefits of the temporary 
rules.\35\ Below we discuss the costs and benefits of each provision of 
the temporary rules, as well as their effects on efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \35\ Section 2(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. 77b(b)] 
requires the Commission, when engaging in rulemaking where it is 
required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or 
appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the 
protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency, 
competition, and capital formation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Broad Economic Considerations
    Below we summarize the expected economic effects of the final 
temporary rules. These temporary rules will allow eligible issuers 
greater flexibility to access capital under Regulation Crowdfunding on 
an expedited basis. We expect the temporary rules to facilitate capital 
formation for eligible issuers. Further, relief from certain

[[Page 27122]]

timing and information requirements and the introduction of the option 
to solicit investor interest before preparing financial disclosures are 
expected to reduce some of the barriers to Regulation Crowdfunding, 
making the capital raising process more efficient for eligible issuers. 
By providing targeted relief in a market segment that primarily 
attracts small businesses, which are disproportionately affected by 
downturns, we expect the temporary rules to incrementally enhance 
competition between small businesses and larger companies (which tend 
to be less financially constrained).\36\ The temporary rules may also 
facilitate capital formation for small companies that previously raised 
capital from small investors but that have additional financing needs 
as the result of the COVID-19 shock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \36\ Research has related small size to financing constraints, 
and conversely, larger size to being less financially constrained. 
See, e.g., Nathalie Moyen (2004) Investment--Cash Flow 
Sensitivities: Constrained versus Unconstrained Firms, Journal of 
Finance 59(5), 2061-2092; Christopher Hennessy, Amnon Levy, and Toni 
Whited (2007) Testing Q Theory with Financing Frictions, Journal of 
Financial Economics 83(3), 691-717. Other studies also show that 
diversified firms can rely on internal capital markets to mitigate 
financing constraints. See, e.g., Venkat Kuppuswamy and Bel[eacute]n 
Villalonga (2016) Does Diversification Create Value in the Presence 
of External Financing Constraints? Evidence from the 2007-2009 
Financial Crisis, Management Science 62(4), 905-923 (showing that 
``the value of corporate diversification increased during the 2007-
2009 financial crisis'' and that ``conglomerates' access to internal 
capital markets became more valuable'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We recognize that the effects of the temporary rules on capital 
formation may be relatively limited if the issuers relying on the 
provided relief would have otherwise pursued a Regulation Crowdfunding 
offering and raised a similar amount of financing in the absence of the 
relief. However, reliance on the relief might still enable such issuers 
to optimize their financing cost and benefit from a more efficient and 
streamlined offering process.
    We recognize that temporarily relaxing certain substantive and 
disclosure requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding may incrementally 
raise concerns about investor losses, either due to the investors' 
reduced time period within which to make an informed decision about an 
offering or the increased ability of opportunistic issuers seeking to 
exploit COVID-19 concerns to raise capital from investors through 
crowdfunding in an expedited timeframe. Generally, however, the 
aggregate incremental effect of the temporary rules on retail investor 
losses is likely limited by various factors, including the tailoring of 
the relief (e.g., the eligibility requirements) and the modest size of 
the Regulation Crowdfunding market compared to other market segments 
that draw small investors. In one potential scenario, investors that 
receive less information about issuers as a result of the temporary 
relief from reviewed financial statement requirements may provide a 
lower amount of financing or financing at a higher cost, which may 
deter relatively more established, higher-potential issuers from 
relying on the temporary rules, resulting in adverse selection. At the 
same time, the substantial, market-wide nature of the negative shock to 
small issuers' cash flows and financing needs may prompt both low- and 
high-potential issuers to rely on the temporary relief in order to 
raise funds on an expedited basis, which might counteract such adverse 
selection. It is difficult to predict which effect will dominate.
    Importantly, several conditions of the temporary rules are expected 
to preserve investor protection. As discussed below, the eligibility 
requirements exclude issuers that were noncompliant with the 
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding in previous offerings that 
resulted in sales. Further, to the extent that investors know less 
about newly formed issuers with a limited track record, the incremental 
risk of the temporary relief to investors is reduced by the exclusion 
from eligibility of issuers formed less than six months prior to the 
offering. This limitation on eligibility will tailor the relief to 
assist existing issuers that require additional funds because of 
adverse effects caused by the closures and safety measures designed to 
slow the spread of COVID-19. Issuers are required to disclose reliance 
on the temporary rules to investors, enabling more informed decisions. 
While issuers may solicit investor interest after an initial Form C 
filing lacking financial disclosures, intermediaries are not allowed to 
accept investor commitments before the issuer provides all required 
financial information.
    In addition, several essential safeguards contained in the existing 
Regulation Crowdfunding rules, including offering and investment 
limits, will continue to apply. Crucially, investment limits serve to 
limit the potential magnitude of investor losses, irrespective of 
cause. Further, Regulation Crowdfunding offerings will continue to be 
conducted through registered crowdfunding intermediaries, which remain 
subject to Commission and FINRA oversight. Crowdfunding intermediaries 
remain required to take measures to reduce the risk of fraud, provide 
investor education materials and issuer disclosures to investors, and 
meet other substantive requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. 
Intermediaries remain required to provide communications channels on 
the online platform to allow investors to draw on the wisdom of the 
crowd, particularly in analyzing dynamic information about short-term 
offerings. Issuers remain subject to the extensive disclosure 
requirements of Form C as well as annual report obligations. While the 
temporary rules provide exceptions to certain timing requirements of 
Regulation Crowdfunding for eligible issuers, investors remain able to 
rescind their commitments within 48 hours from the time of making their 
commitment, and of a material change to the offering.
    In light of the temporary nature of the relief, tailored 
eligibility criteria, and targeted, conditional relief provisions, we 
expect the aggregate economic effects of these temporary rules to be 
modest relative to the economic effects of the 2015 Regulation 
Crowdfunding rules. Further, the temporary rules may have a limited 
effect compared to the overall economic effects of the COVID-19 shock 
and the associated changes in market conditions on affected issuers. In 
particular, diminished aggregate and industry outlook, investor 
confidence, and risk tolerance, as well as negative wealth effects of 
the market downturn on investor portfolios and reduced disposable 
income due to labor market disruptions may have a negative effect on 
investors' willingness to participate in offerings, the likelihood of 
offering success, the amount of capital raised, and the offering terms 
under Regulation Crowdfunding, irrespective of the temporary rules. 
However, it is also possible that some investors in crowdfunding 
offerings are more motivated by nonmonetary considerations, such as a 
desire to invest in the local community or loyalty to a small business 
whose products they buy. Under such circumstances, the deterioration of 
financing conditions in the Regulation Crowdfunding market would be 
modest relative to that in the market for small cap registered 
offerings. Similarly, the temporary rules may have minimal effects on 
investor performance in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings, which, 
regardless of the temporary relief, may decline as a result of the 
effects of the shock on business risk and survival rates of small 
firms, particularly in industries heavily represented in the Regulation 
Crowdfunding market, the probability of follow-on financing or

[[Page 27123]]

exit, and the valuations obtained as a result of such transactions.
    We evaluate the economic effects specific to each provision of the 
temporary rules relative to the baseline in greater detail in Sections 
VI.B through VI.D below.
2. Baseline and Affected Parties
    The baseline is composed of existing Regulation Crowdfunding 
regulations and industry practices.\37\ Given the exemption's offering 
limit, since Regulation Crowdfunding became effective in 2016, it has 
been primarily utilized by small businesses (which typically lack 
significant internal cash flows or access to other securities market 
financing options). Table 1 below presents data on the characteristics 
of issuers in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \37\ For a more detailed discussion, see Facilitating Capital 
Formation and Expanding Investment Opportunities by Improving Access 
to Capital in Private Markets (Mar. 4, 2020), Release No. 33-10763 
[85 FR 17956 (Mar. 31, 2020)]; Report to the Commission: Regulation 
Crowdfunding (Jun. 18, 2019), available at: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/regulation-crowdfunding-2019_0.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/files/regulation-crowdfunding-2019_0.pdf</a> (``2019 Regulation 
Crowdfunding Report'').
    \38\ The estimates are based on data from Form C or the latest 
amendment to it and exclude withdrawn offerings.

     Table 1--Characteristics of Issuers in Regulation Crowdfunding
             Offerings: May 16, 2016-December 31, 2019 \38\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                              Average         Median
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Age in years............................             2.9             1.8
Number of employees.....................             5.3             3.0
Total assets............................        $455,280         $29,982
Total revenues..........................        $325,481              $0
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The median crowdfunding offering was by an issuer that was 
incorporated approximately two years earlier and that employed about 
three people. The median issuer had total assets of approximately 
$30,000 and no revenues (just over half of the offerings were by 
issuers with no revenues). Approximately ten percent of offerings were 
by issuers that had attained profitability in the most recent fiscal 
year prior to the offering.
    Small businesses often face significant financing constraints.\39\ 
Financing constraints make firms more vulnerable to economic downturns 
and other adverse shocks.\40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \39\ Small businesses often lack access to securities markets 
and rely on personal savings, business profits, personal and 
business credit, and friends and family as sources of capital. See 
U.S. Department of Treasury (2017) A Financial System That Creates 
Economic Opportunities: Banks and Credit Unions, June 2017, <a href="https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/A%20Financial%20System.pdf">https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Documents/A%20Financial%20System.pdf</a> (``Treasury Report''). According to one 
study relying on the data from the 2014 Annual Survey of 
Entrepreneurs, approximately 64 percent of small businesses relied 
on personal or family savings, compared to 0.6 percent receiving VC 
capital. About one-third of businesses used banks and other 
financial institutions as a source of capital for financing business 
operations in 2014. A significant share of businesses that 
established new funding relationships continued to have unmet credit 
needs. See Alicia Robb (2018) Financing Patterns and Credit Market 
Experiences: A Comparison by Race and Ethnicity for U.S. Employer 
Firms, Working Paper. See also Alicia M. Robb and David Robinson 
(2014) The Capital Structure Decisions of New Firms, Review of 
Financial Studies 27(1), 153-179 (showing that, while 
entrepreneurial firms frequently rely on outside loans, outside 
equity use is uncommon); Rebel Cole and Tatyana Sokolyk (2013) How 
Do Start-Up Firms Finance Their Assets? Evidence from the Kauffman 
Firm Surveys, Working Paper (showing, based on the 2004 Kauffman 
Firm Survey, that at start-up 76 percent of firms relied on credit, 
including 24 percent that used trade credit, 44 percent--business 
credit, and 55 percent--personal credit (percentages do not add up 
to 100 percent because firms may use multiple types of credit)).
    \40\ Studies of the 2008-2009 financial crisis have documented 
disproportionate impacts of the crisis on the outcomes and 
employment of financially constrained small businesses. See, e.g., 
Michael Siemer (2019) Employment Effects of Financial Constraints 
during the Great Recession, Review of Economics and Statistics 
101(1), 16-29; Arthur Kennickell, Myron Kwast, and Jonathan Pogach 
(2017) Small Businesses and Small Business Finance during the 
Financial Crisis and the Great Recession: New Evidence from the 
Survey of Consumer Finances, In: J. Haltiwanger, E. Hurst, J. 
Miranda, and A. Schoar (Eds.), Measuring Entrepreneurial Businesses: 
Current Knowledge and Challenges, University of Chicago Press, 291-
349; Burcu Duygan-Bump, Alexey Levkov, and Judit Montoriol-Garriga 
(2015) Financing Constraints and Unemployment: Evidence from the 
Great Recession, Journal of Monetary Economics 75, 89-105. Various 
studies of traded small-cap companies show that small firms, which 
tend to be most financially constrained, are disproportionately 
affected by downturns or tightening credit conditions. See, e.g., 
Gabriel Perez[hyphen]Quiros and Allan Timmermann (2000) Firm Size 
and Cyclical Variations in Stock Returns, Journal of Finance 55(3), 
1229-1262 (showing that ``small firms display the highest degree of 
asymmetry in their risk across recession and expansion states, which 
translates into a higher sensitivity of their expected stock returns 
with respect to variables that measure credit market conditions''); 
Murillo Campello and Long Chen (2010) Are Financial Constraints 
Priced? Evidence from Firm Fundamentals and Stock Returns, Journal 
of Money, Credit, and Banking 42(6), 1185-1198 (finding that 
financially constrained firms' business fundamentals are 
significantly more sensitive to macroeconomic movements than 
unconstrained firms' fundamentals). See also Eugene Fama and Kenneth 
French (1993) Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and 
Bonds, Journal of Financial Economics 3, 3-56.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    During that period, based on the analysis of EDGAR filings, we 
estimate that 2,003 offerings were initiated, seeking an aggregate 
target amount of $126.9 million and up to an aggregate maximum amount 
of $1,174.2 million, and 795 offerings reported aggregate proceeds of 
$169.9 million.\41\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \41\ Issuers that have not raised the target amount or not filed 
a report on Form C-U are not included in the estimate of proceeds. 
See also 2019 Regulation Crowdfunding Report, at 15, footnote 40.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The baseline also includes the recent and ongoing effects of the 
disruption to

[[Page 27124]]

the U.S. and global economy related to COVID-19, interventions aimed at 
mitigating its effects, and adverse changes in macroeconomic and 
financing market conditions (collectively referred to as ``the shock'' 
or ``the COVID-19'' shock below). As part of the baseline, small 
businesses eligible under the existing rules have been facing and are 
expected to continue to face significant adverse effects of the shock, 
including, but not limited to, declines in consumer demand and 
revenues, particularly in consumer-facing industries, such as 
restaurants, recreation/lifestyle, and retail \42\ (e.g., as a result 
of changes in consumer confidence, commuting and travel patterns, 
declines in purchasing power, and explicit restrictions on the 
operation of certain businesses); disruptions to workforce and supply 
chains; and declines in investor sentiment that affect the availability 
of financing, valuations, and potential for exits.\43\ At the same 
time, small issuers eligible under the temporary rules may also qualify 
for emergency relief under other economic assistance programs, which 
may mitigate some of the adverse impacts described above and the 
financing constraints stemming from the shock.\44\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \42\ See, e.g., Devin Thorpe (2019) Startup Restauranteurs Find 
Willing Investors via Crowdfunding, Forbes, September 28, 2019, and 
2019 US Equity Crowdfunding Stats--Year in Review, available at: 
<a href="https://crowdwise.org/funding-portals/2019-equity-crowdfunding-stats-data/">https://crowdwise.org/funding-portals/2019-equity-crowdfunding-stats-data/</a>.

    \44\ See infra note 50 and accompanying text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We expect the temporary rules to affect issuers, intermediaries, 
and investors in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings. As of December 
2019, we estimate that 1,827 issuers initiated 2,003 Regulation 
Crowdfunding offerings, excluding withdrawn offerings.\45\ As discussed 
below, eligibility criteria of the temporary rules exclude (1) issuers 
that were organized and had operations for less than six months prior 
to the commencement of the offering and (2) issuers that were not 
compliant with Regulation Crowdfunding requirements with regard to any 
prior offerings in which they sold securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \45\ These figures are based on the three-and-a-half-year period 
since inception of Regulation Crowdfunding, with offering activity 
accelerating in the second half of the sample period. It is 
difficult to predict how many of the past issuers will conduct a 
follow-on offering in reliance on the relief as well as how existing 
market conditions, which affect both supply and demand of capital, 
will affect the flow of new crowdfunding offerings relative to 
historical data, thus it is difficult to extrapolate from these 
numbers the flow of new crowdfunding offerings projected during the 
approximately four-month time frame during which temporary relief 
will be available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Turning to the first eligibility requirement, historical data 
provides an indication of the potential share of offerings eligible for 
temporary relief among all offerings: From inception of Regulation 
Crowdfunding through the end of December 2019, we estimate that 1,537 
(approximately 77 percent) offerings were initiated by 1,407 eligible 
issuers.\46\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \46\ In addition, we recognize that many of the issuers that 
initiated past Regulation Crowdfunding offerings as of the end of 
2019 may meet the six-month eligibility criterion as of the 
effective date of the temporary rules, should they wish to avail 
themselves of the temporary relief for a follow-on offering under 
Regulation Crowdfunding.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We lack the data or a methodology to predict how many issuers will 
be rendered ineligible as a result of the second eligibility 
requirement because it is difficult to estimate the percentage of prior 
Regulation Crowdfunding issuers that will seek to conduct a follow-on 
offering and that were not compliant with one or more of the 
requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding with regard to a prior offering 
in which they sold securities. Based on historical data, this 
percentage may be modest because relatively few Regulation Crowdfunding 
issuers have initiated follow-on offerings in the past. We estimate 
that, from inception through the end of 2019, there were 149 repeat 
Regulation Crowdfunding issuers, including 116 such issuers that had 
reported successful completion of at least one Regulation Crowdfunding 
offering on Form C-U as of the end of 2019.\47\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \47\ This figure likely provides a lower bound on the number of 
issuers that have initiated a follow-on offering after successfully 
completing a prior offering due to incomplete reporting of offering 
proceeds on Form C-U. See supra note 41.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Staff's experience with, and analysis of, filings has revealed 
differences among issuers' compliance with financial statement 
requirements, the requirement to file an annual report on Form C-AR 
(for issuers that have sold securities under the exemption and have not 
terminated their reporting obligations), and the requirement to file a 
final progress update on Form C-U.\48\ We further recognize that the 
rate of participation of repeat issuers based on historical Regulation 
Crowdfunding data may underestimate the rate of repeat issuers likely 
to seek capital under Regulation Crowdfunding while the temporary rules 
are in effect because: (1) Follow-on Regulation Crowdfunding offerings 
have become more frequent in the latter part of the historical sample 
period since more initial offerings had been conducted, and we expect 
the number of repeat issuers to continue to increase as time elapses 
and more issuers, intermediaries, and investors gain experience with 
Regulation Crowdfunding; (2) financing needs of issuers affected by the 
shock may be greater than predicted by historical data, leading to 
increased reliance on follow-on external financing, compared to 
historical rates; and (3) the relief provided by the temporary rules 
may make a Regulation Crowdfunding offering a more attractive and 
viable financing alternative for small issuers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \48\ See 2019 Regulation Crowdfunding Study, at 28.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We estimate that, as of the end of 2019, there were 45 registered 
funding portals, excluding funding portals that had withdrawn their 
registration. In addition, 16 registered broker-dealers have 
participated in crowdfunding offerings, excluding withdrawn offerings. 
Information on the number of investors per offering is not available 
for the full sample of Regulation Crowdfunding offerings, and it is not 
required to be reported in progress updates on Form C-U.\49\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \49\ See 2019 Regulation Crowdfunding Report, at 21, footnote 54 
and accompanying text. According to one industry report, the total 
number of investors in successful offerings increased from 77,558 in 
2017 to 147,448 in 2018.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We are unable to predict the number of issuers likely to rely on 
the temporary rules while they are in effect. On the one hand, the 
number of issuers seeking capital under Regulation Crowdfunding may 
exceed the estimates based on extrapolation from historical data 
because of the significant increase in small businesses' external 
financing needs as a result of the economic shock of COVID-19. Further, 
the flexibility and offering process efficiencies afforded by the 
temporary rules may draw additional issuers to Regulation Crowdfunding.
    On the other hand, some issuers eligible under the temporary rules, 
particularly better established issuers or issuers that are more 
connected to angel investors, may choose to pursue another exempt 
offering, such as an offering under 17 CFR 230.506 (Rule 506 of 
Regulation D), to meet their financing needs. Other such issuers may 
choose to pursue a Regulation Crowdfunding offering but forgo the 
temporary relief in an attempt to send a favorable signal of their 
financial soundness in the face of the COVID-19 shock to prospective 
investors. The latter point may not be as significant for the 
likelihood of issuer uptake of the temporary relief to the extent that 
issuers not reliant on the temporary relief may still have to disclose 
material information about

[[Page 27125]]

business and financial risks, including as a result of the COVID-19 
shock, in their offering and periodic disclosures. The prominent 
disclosures of offering process and disclosure accommodations that an 
issuer is relying upon under the temporary rules due to being impacted 
by COVID-19 may cause some investors to forgo investing in those 
offerings out of concern about business risk, which may in turn deter 
some issuers from relying on the temporary rules. Further, some small 
businesses eligible under the temporary rules also may be eligible for 
other emergency relief or financial assistance,\50\ which may reduce 
their reliance on the temporary rules.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. Conditions of the Temporary Rules: Eligibility Criteria and 
Disclosure of Reliance on Temporary Relief

    The temporary rules include several conditions for using the 
relief. First, to be eligible under the temporary rules, issuers must 
have been organized and had operations for at least six months prior to 
the commencement of the offering. This condition is intended to target 
relief towards issuers that were in existence prior to the COVID-19 
shock and suffered its adverse effects on their business, resulting in 
a need for financing to be raised on an expedited basis. This provision 
will prevent more recently formed issuers from realizing the benefits 
of the temporary relief, which could limit the benefits of the rule on 
capital formation and efficiency. As discussed above, from inception 
through the end of 2019, we estimate that 77 percent of offerings were 
initiated by issuers that would have met this eligibility 
criterion.\51\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \51\ The fraction of offerings eligible based on this criterion 
is estimated, given data availability, on the basis of the issuer 
having been organized for at least six months as of the initial Form 
C filing and having reported positive cash or other assets, 
revenues, net profits, employees, debt, cost of goods sold, or taxes 
paid for the most recent fiscal period shown in the initial Form C 
filing. See supra note 9. We recognize that this estimate may not be 
a precise reflection of the number of eligible issuers to the extent 
that an issuer may have had operations over the past six months but 
may not yet have reported positive financial statement activity 
based on the above metrics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We recognize that some issuers that are organized within six months 
prior to the offering, and thus ineligible under the temporary rules, 
may also experience adverse effects of the shock, including being 
unable to raise adequate financing in an initial crowdfunding offering 
or experiencing challenges in executing their business plan as a result 
of the shock. This eligibility condition might place newly organized 
issuers at an incremental competitive disadvantage. Issuers whose age 
is approaching six months might postpone the offering until they are 
eligible under the temporary rules. Generally, any effect of this 
provision on competition is likely limited compared to such issuers' 
potential competitive disadvantage stemming from limited investor 
recognition as a result of being recently formed and having a limited 
track record.
    Second, issuers that previously sold securities in a Regulation 
Crowdfunding offering and were not in compliance with Regulation 
Crowdfunding requirements are not eligible to rely on the temporary 
rules. To the extent that an expedited offering process might 
incrementally reduce the ability of investors to analyze information 
about the offering, the exclusion of such previously noncompliant 
issuers from an expedited offering process is expected to mitigate 
potential effects on investors and reinforce investor protection. This 
condition may also incrementally incentivize issuers to remain 
compliant with Regulation Crowdfunding requirements, further 
strengthening investor protection. As a result of the provision, some 
issuers that have failed to comply with Regulation Crowdfunding 
requirements will not realize the benefits of the temporary rules, 
which would incrementally limit the capital formation benefits of the 
temporary rules. Some of the noncompliance might be due to the issuer's 
lack of securities market experience and inability to afford outside 
securities counsel and a dedicated accounting staff to prepare 
compliant offering materials or ongoing disclosure, rather than 
intentional noncompliance. However, we believe that applying the 
exclusion to noncompliant issuers that had raised capital in a prior 
offering appropriately balances such considerations with the need to 
preserve investor protection, particularly in an environment of 
heightened market risk.
    Relatedly, the temporary rules amend the intermediary requirements 
of Rule 301 and specify that intermediaries must have a reasonable 
basis for believing that an issuer seeking to rely on the temporary 
rules that has previously sold securities in a Regulation Crowdfunding 
offering has complied with the requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. 
This provision is expected to reinforce the investor protection 
benefits of the described eligibility condition while imposing an 
incremental cost on intermediaries that facilitate offerings reliant on 
the temporary rules. The provision that allows intermediaries to rely 
on the representations of the issuer concerning compliance, unless the 
intermediary has reason to question the reliability of those 
representations, is expected to moderate the economic effects of this 
intermediary requirement.
    Third, the temporary rules specify that a condition to each aspect 
of the temporary relief is clear disclosure to investors with respect 
to the issuer's reliance on the temporary relief. Relatedly, the 
temporary rules make conforming amendments to intermediary requirements 
to ensure that investors are apprised of issuer reliance on the 
temporary rules. By conveying the fact that certain offering process 
mechanics may differ from those of a typical Regulation Crowdfunding 
offering, as well as the fact that the issuer is being affected by 
COVID-19, this disclosure requirement is expected to benefit investors 
and allow them to make a better informed investment decision. Further, 
to the extent that it provides clarity as to the modified offering 
process terms, it is expected to facilitate competition for investor 
capital among issuers that rely on the temporary relief and issuers 
that are ineligible for, or choose not to rely on, the temporary 
relief. We recognize that some investors may fail to fully consider the 
described disclosure when making their investment decisions. However, 
the incremental effects of this failure to fully factor in the issuer's 
reliance on temporary relief may be modest given the continued 
application of other essential investor protection safeguards and the 
fact that, under the baseline, these same investors may fail to fully 
process information contained in other substantive disclosures under 
Regulation Crowdfunding and materials about the offering process.
    Finally, the relief under these rules is limited to eligible 
issuers seeking to conduct a Regulation Crowdfunding offering on an 
expedited basis due to circumstances relating to COVID-19 during the 
period specified in the temporary rules. The time-limited, tailored 
nature of the relief is expected to limit the aggregate economic 
effects of the rule while also targeting the benefits to small issuers 
that are most affected by the shock.
    We have considered alternatives to the described conditions of the 
temporary rules. As an alternative, we could relax the issuer age 
requirement (e.g., removing the requirement for the issuer to have 
operations or shortening the period from six to three months) or waive 
it but preserve the exclusion of noncompliant issuers in prior 
offerings. As another alternative, we could extend

[[Page 27126]]

the relief under the temporary rules to all first-time Regulation 
Crowdfunding issuers or to all issuers below a certain size, such as $1 
million in total assets. These alternatives could expand the capital 
formation benefits compared to the temporary rules and extend the 
benefits to a larger pool of financially constrained issuers that may 
seek capital on an expedited basis from retail investors. As of the end 
of 2019, we estimate that 78 percent of offerings were by issuers 
organized at least six months and 86 percent of offerings--by issuers 
organized at least three months--prior to the initial Form C filing for 
that offering, irrespective of whether they had operations; 91 percent 
of offerings were by first-time crowdfunding issuers; and 93 percent of 
offerings were by crowdfunding issuers with total assets below $1 
million (these are overlapping subsets of issuers). However, relaxing 
or waiving the issuer age requirement or extending the relief to all 
initial Regulation Crowdfunding offerings would result in offering 
process and disclosure relief being temporarily extended to less well-
known issuers with shorter track records, potentially increasing risks 
to investors and adverse selection, compared to the temporary rules.
    As another alternative, we could waive the requirement to 
prominently disclose reliance on the relief as a condition of using the 
relief provided in the temporary rules. Compared to the temporary 
rules, this alternative may increase the attractiveness of the relief 
to prospective Regulation Crowdfunding issuers and decrease issuer 
concerns about prominently signaling to investors the vulnerability of 
their business to the effects of COVID-19 (however, issuers not relying 
on the temporary relief may have to disclose some related information 
about the effects of COVID-19 in offering materials and periodic 
reports if it materially affects the risks facing their business), and 
the modified information and offering process requirements of their 
offering. At the same time, by failing to provide relevant disclosure 
to investors about material modifications to offering process and 
disclosures applicable to a given offering, this alternative may result 
in less informed investor decisions, compared to the temporary rules.
    As another alternative, we could shorten or extend the period of 
the temporary relief. Such an alternative would decrease or increase, 
respectively, the aggregate economic effects of the rules and the 
number of issuers eligible to qualify for the relief, compared to the 
temporary rules.

C. Temporary Relief From Certain Financial Information Requirements

1. Temporary Omission of Financial Statements From Initial Form C 
Filing
    The temporary rules provide flexibility for eligible issuers to 
assess the probable interest in a Regulation Crowdfunding offering 
prior to preparation of full offering materials that include financial 
statement information.\52\ The temporary rules are expected to benefit 
issuers by allowing greater flexibility to communicate with prospective 
investors about the contemplated offering and to gauge market interest 
prior to incurring the full cost of preparation of financial statement 
disclosures. The temporary rules are expected to particularly benefit 
prospective issuers that do not have current financial statements 
available and that may otherwise find it difficult to prepare the 
required financial statements in order to launch a timely offering. 
This is expected to have favorable incremental effects on capital 
formation and the efficiency of the capital raising process for 
eligible issuers that choose to rely on this provision. These benefits 
are expected to be particularly important in the current environment of 
increased market uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 shock, which 
can make it more difficult for issuers to gauge prospective investor 
demand for their offering. Further, issuers with binding financing 
constraints and scarce cash reserves may hesitate to incur the upfront 
costs of preparation of financial statement disclosures for an offering 
that may fail to draw prospective investor interest. Among various 
issuers eligible under the temporary rules, this benefit is likely to 
be especially valuable for smaller, less well known, and first-time 
issuers that may not have financial statement disclosures otherwise 
available and that may lack an accurate understanding of prospective 
investor demand for their securities, have a high degree of information 
asymmetry, or operate in lines of business characterized by a 
considerable degree of uncertainty and/or more pronounced effects of 
the COVID-19 shock.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \52\ See temporary Rule 201(z)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    If, after communicating with investors, the issuer is not confident 
that it would attract sufficient investor interest, the issuer could 
amend offering plans or the target amount of the offering, reconsider 
the contemplated offering structure and terms, postpone the offering, 
or explore alternative methods of raising capital. The temporary rules 
may attract some eligible issuers that may be uncertain about the 
prospects of raising investor capital through a Regulation Crowdfunding 
offering, thus potentially promoting competition for investor capital 
as well as capital formation in this market segment. The temporary 
rules are expected to reduce uncertainty about whether a Regulation 
Crowdfunding offering could be completed successfully before the issuer 
incurs the costs of preparing financial statement disclosures. While 
this provision can reduce the risk of a failed offering after an issuer 
has incurred financial statement costs, an issuer that solicits 
interest on the basis of a public filing of an initial offering 
circular may still incur some reputational costs of failure to attract 
sufficient investor commitments.
    We recognize that there may also be potential costs associated with 
the temporary rules. In particular, if financial statement information 
is omitted at the investor interest solicitation stage, it may result 
in an incomplete representation of the risk of an offering. If 
investors later fail to read the offering circular that is subsequently 
amended to include financial information disclosures before making the 
investment decision, they may make less informed investment decisions. 
In the specific context of the COVID-19 shock, to the extent that 
issuer financial disclosures are historical in nature (although issuers 
must disclose certain material subsequent events in the notes to 
financial statements), such disclosures may be relatively less 
meaningful for purposes of assessing the current financial condition 
and future growth prospects of an issuer that has experienced 
significant adverse effects of the COVID-19 shock. In some cases, 
investors may be members of a local community that know the business 
well, which may give them insight into the issuer's prospects during 
and after the COVID-19 shock. Further, historical financial disclosures 
may be incrementally less meaningful for evaluating the business of a 
relatively recently formed or development-stage issuer (e.g., an issuer 
organized more than six months but less than a year prior to the 
commencement of an offering or an issuer that has not yet developed 
substantial business operations). Finally, intermediaries for issuers 
relying on the temporary rules would not be allowed to accept investor 
commitments until financial information disclosures are provided.
    Overall, potential investor protection concerns discussed above are 
expected to be substantially alleviated by several factors: The 
application of the anti-fraud

[[Page 27127]]

provisions of the Federal and state securities laws; \53\ prominent 
disclosures to investors regarding reliance on the temporary rules; the 
requirement that financial disclosures be available before investor 
commitments may be accepted, providing investors (and the Commission) 
with the ability to review financial information; the availability of 
investor education materials required to be provided by crowdfunding 
intermediaries before investing; the continued application of other 
provisions of Regulation Crowdfunding, including ones expected to 
provide additional investor protection, such as investment limits, 
offering limits, crowdfunding intermediary obligations to take measures 
to reduce the risk of fraud and other intermediary requirements, 
periodic reporting requirements, and issuer eligibility restrictions; 
and the reputational incentives of issuers and intermediaries, as well 
as the potential risk of litigation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \53\ The initial offering circular used to solicit investors 
under the temporary rules will continue to be treated as an offer of 
securities.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Because the filing of the initial offering circular used to solicit 
investor interest will be a requirement, this provision will provide 
information to investors and allow them to compare the initial offering 
circular with any amended offering statement disclosures, leading to 
potentially more informed investment decisions. In addition, the 
requirement in the temporary rules that the initial offering circular 
used to solicit investor interest contain all offering disclosures as 
specified in Regulation Crowdfunding, except financial statement 
information, is expected to maintain investor protection. Moreover, 
prominent disclosure regarding reliance on the temporary rules that 
reminds investors to review the amended offering circular augmented 
with financial disclosures, also required to be filed, is expected to 
encourage investors to make informed decisions after considering the 
full financial picture of the issuer.
    As an alternative to the temporary rules, we could permit eligible 
issuers to avail themselves, on a temporary, conditional basis, of the 
option to engage in a broader range of pre-offering communications than 
what is permitted under the temporary rules, such as by allowing pre-
filing solicitations of interest. Such an alternative would afford 
greater flexibility to issuers and potentially result in larger capital 
formation benefits, compared to the temporary rules. However, we 
believe that a more limited approach is appropriate in the context of 
temporary, conditional relief we are adopting to assist issuers 
affected by the COVID-19 shock.
2. Temporary Relief From the Review Report Requirement for Smaller 
Offerings
    As discussed in Section III above, we are providing temporary, 
conditional exemptive relief from the independent accountant review 
report requirement to issuers in Regulation Crowdfunding offerings of 
up to $250,000, inclusive of amounts sold in the prior 12 months, in 
reliance on Regulation Crowdfunding. Under the existing rules, issuers 
are not required to submit an independent accountant's review report if 
they are offering up to $107,000. Issuers seeking to conduct an 
offering under Regulation Crowdfunding in excess of $107,000 at this 
time may be facing challenges in obtaining reviewed financial 
statements in a time frame that would be helpful to an issuer with 
immediate capital needs due to the COVID-19 shock. By allowing issuers 
to gain more timely access to capital, the temporary rules are expected 
to facilitate capital formation and benefit eligible issuers affected 
by the COVID-19 shock that may be facing unexpected financing 
constraints or delays in raising capital due to a temporary inability 
to retain an independent accountant.\54\ Temporary Rule 201(z)(3) 
allows eligible issuers in offerings of up to $250,000, rather than 
$107,000, to provide financial statements and certain information from 
the issuer's Federal income tax returns, both certified by the 
principal executive officer, in accordance with Rule 201(t)(1) 
requirements, if reviewed or audited financial statements of the issuer 
are not then available.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \54\ This may be a particularly salient concern for small 
issuers that sought to use an individual Certified Public Accountant 
(``CPA'') or a small accounting firm to obtain a review report as 
such accounting firms' operations and business may themselves be 
adversely impacted by the COVID-19 shock, resulting in potential 
reductions in service, extended delays, and additional costs for 
small issuers that require a review report.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We expect this relief to allow issuers to raise capital without 
incurring costs and delays involved in an independent accountant's 
review of their financial statements. This may incrementally enhance 
the efficiency of conducting the offering and yield capital formation 
benefits for eligible issuers that find themselves financially 
constrained and in need of financing in excess of $107,000 but up to 
$250,000 on an expedited basis as a result of the COVID-19 shock. To 
the extent that issuers relying on the relief under these temporary 
rules are likely to be small businesses, this provision is expected to 
incrementally promote competition between such smaller issuers and 
larger issuers.
    The upfront costs of obtaining a review report may be nontrivial 
for small issuers, particularly issuers experiencing declines in 
internal cash flows as a result of the COVID-19 shock. Available filing 
data does not allow us to estimate the cost of obtaining a review 
report. In the 2015 Regulation Crowdfunding Adopting Release, the 
Commission estimated review costs to be approximately $1,500 to 
$18,000.\55\ We also consider more recent information about the costs 
of a review report available from commenters and industry sources. For 
example, one industry source estimates the cost of a review as $2,000 
to $2,450 for a single-owner LLC/S-Corp/Sole Proprietor issuer that has 
not previously had a review or audit but is in possession of full 
financial records.\56\ If the same single-owner issuer that has not 
previously had a review or audit instead tracks financials in a 
spreadsheet format (e.g., because it lacks an in-house accountant), the 
same source estimates the review cost as approximately $2,400 to 
$2,950.\57\ A commenter on the 2019 Harmonization Concept Release \58\ 
states that it has ``interviewed dozens of CPA firms and found that the 
average cost of reviewing a company that has two years of financial 
history is at least $6,000'' and that ``[f]or a company with no 
history, this quote (from many CPA firms) has been in the $1,500 to 
$2,500 range.'' \59\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    It is difficult to estimate how many of the eligible issuers will 
elect to avail themselves of this relief. Based on data from inception 
through the end of 2019, we estimate that 59 offerings by eligible 
issuers (76 offerings by all issuers, irrespective of age) sought above 
$107,000 but no more than $250,000.\60\

[[Page 27128]]

It is possible that some of the issuers within the eligible range will 
forgo reliance on the temporary rules in order to more credibly signal 
to prospective investors the quality of their financial disclosures. 
From a costly signaling standpoint, eligible issuers with lower 
information asymmetries or higher potential might incur the review 
report cost in order to differentiate themselves from eligible issuers 
that choose to provide a principal executive officer certification with 
their financial disclosures in lieu of a review report. This might 
introduce adverse selection among eligible issuers that choose to avail 
themselves of the relief from the review report requirement in reliance 
on the temporary rules, which in turn might limit investor willingness 
to back such offerings and moderate the capital formation benefits of 
the temporary relief. At the same time, such quality-based separation 
may not occur if the business and cash flow disruptions due to the 
COVID-19 shock cause a number of both low- and high-potential eligible 
issuers to be unable to incur the upfront costs and delays associated 
with obtaining a review report and thus elect to forgo it. Further, if 
the market volatility and recent business disruptions due to the COVID-
19 shock effectively render historical financial disclosures and 
associated proxies for their reliability less relevant for projecting 
an issuer's future growth potential, risks, and cash flows, a review 
report may become a noisier and less informative signal of quality for 
affected issuers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \60\ The above counts are based on XML data in Form C filings. 
See supra note 51 for the definition of eligible issuers. Amounts 
sought are based on data either in the initial Form C filing, or the 
latest amendment to it at the offering level, if the offering has 
been amended. Withdrawn offerings are excluded. The above estimates 
are calculated at the offering level and do not adjust for issuers 
with follow-on offerings within 12 months of prior financing raised 
under Regulation Crowdfunding. In cases of offerings that accept 
oversubscriptions, the maximum offer amount is used to estimate the 
number of issuers eligible under the temporary rules. See also supra 
note 45 and accompanying and following text.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We recognize that the number of issuers seeking up to $250,000 in 
reliance on the temporary rules may be greater than suggested by the 
historical data on the distribution of Regulation Crowdfunding offering 
amounts if the exemptive relief from the review report requirement 
under the temporary rules leads issuers that would otherwise cap their 
offering size at a lower threshold under the existing rules (to avoid 
the costs of a review report) to offer a larger amount in reliance on 
the temporary rules. For example, there was some bunching around the 
review report threshold in the historical distribution of offerings as 
of December 2019, with an estimated 275 offerings by eligible issuers 
(356 offerings by all issuers) seeking amounts equal to the review 
report offer size threshold that was in effect at the time of the 
offering.\61\ Some of the issuers in that category might elect to avail 
themselves of the temporary rules and seek larger amounts up to 
$250,000 under the temporary rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \61\ The above counts are based on XML data in Form C filings. 
See id. The estimates consider offerings with offer size of $107,000 
in the period following the April 2017 amendments and offerings with 
offer size of $100,000 in the period prior to the amendments. See 
Inflation Adjustments and Other Technical Amendments under Titles I 
and III of the JOBS Act (Technical Amendments; Interpretation), 
Release No. 33-10332 (Mar. 31, 2017) [82 FR 17545 (Apr. 12, 2017)].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Although a review report provides a more limited level of assurance 
compared to an audit report, reviewed financial statements confer 
valuable informational benefits to investors.\62\ Thus, temporarily 
exempting a broader range of issuers from the review report 
requirement, particularly in an environment of heightened market 
uncertainty, may result in less information for investor decisions and 
additional risks to investor protection. Exemptive relief from the 
review report requirement might weaken the incentives of some issuers 
to provide compliant financial statement disclosures since they no 
longer would be required to undergo a review by an independent 
accountant and to provide such a report to investors, resulting in 
potentially less informative financial disclosures provided to 
investors in affected offerings. For example, some financial statement 
disclosures provided by issuers below the existing review report 
threshold are not prepared in a U.S. GAAP-compliant manner.\63\ As 
discussed above, however, in the specific context of the COVID-19 
shock, to the extent that issuer financial disclosures are historical 
in nature, such disclosures might be relatively less meaningful for 
purposes of assessing the current financial condition and growth 
prospects of an issuer that was financially sound but has experienced 
significant adverse effects as a result of the COVID-19 shock. Further, 
historical financial disclosures may be incrementally less meaningful 
for evaluating the business of a recently formed or development-stage 
issuer.\64\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \62\ See, e.g., Brad Badertscher, Jaewoo Kim, William Kinney, 
and Edward Owens (2018) Verification Services and Financial 
Reporting Quality: Assessing the Potential of Review Procedures, 
Working Paper (``[b]oth reviews and audits yield significantly 
better reporting quality scores and lower cost of debt than zero-
verification compilations. However, model-based reporting quality 
scores of reviews and audits are indistinguishable statistically, on 
average. Regarding broader economics, we find that relative to 
compilations, reviews yield more than half the added interest rate 
benefit associated with an audit, at considerably less than half the 
added cost. Overall, our results suggest reviews may provide a cost-
effective verification alternative to audits, and the potential of 
analytical procedures warrants more attention by audit researchers 
and regulators.'')
    \63\ See, e.g., Letter from CrowdCheck (Oct. 30, 2019) 
commenting on the 2019 Harmonization Concept Release, available at: 
<a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-19/s70819-6368811-196431.pdf">https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-19/s70819-6368811-196431.pdf</a> 
(stating that its belief that ``the larger concern for Regulation CF 
is the fact that, as we discovered in the course of the Compliance 
Survey, issuers making offerings for under $107,000 do not appear to 
be producing financial statements in a format anything close to 
GAAP'').
     Separately, one of the intermediary respondents to the 
Regulation Crowdfunding survey stated that ``smaller issuers that do 
not have reviewed or audited financial statements may find it 
difficult to prepare a statement of changes of equity, because the 
typical accounting software does not print it automatically. This 
respondent stated that these issuers also often have trouble 
accurately preparing a cash flow statement or accounting for stock 
issuances or issuances of stock options and warrants.'' See 2019 
Regulation Crowdfunding Report, at 32.
    \64\ See, e.g., Letter from Mainvest (stating that ``a company 
with no operating history simply does not have historical financial 
information that can be reviewed. Issuers on our platform 
unfortunately are required to get CPA reviews of a balance sheet 
with almost no zeros [sic]. This adds practically no value to 
investor protections and significantly increases up-front costs to 
companies.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Importantly, several provisions of the temporary rules are expected 
to mitigate potential risks to investors. Issuers relying on the 
temporary rules must still provide financial statement disclosures at 
the time of the offering, certified by the principal executive officer. 
Further, an issuer relying on this temporary rule would be required to 
provide prominent disclosure to that end. Moreover, temporary exemptive 
relief from the review report requirement does not preclude liability 
in instances of materially misleading financial disclosures provided at 
the time of the offering, and general anti-fraud provisions and 
liability for offers under Regulation Crowdfunding will continue to 
apply. Finally, as discussed in Section VI.A above, the remaining 
investor protections of Regulation Crowdfunding would generally 
continue to provide significant safeguards for investors in offerings 
reliant on the temporary rules.
    We have considered several alternatives to the temporary rules. The 
temporary rules provide exemptive relief from the review requirement 
for qualifying offerings by eligible issuers. As one alternative, we 
could implement a temporary deferral (e.g., for 90 days after the 
closing of the offering), rather than a waiver of the review report 
requirement for qualifying offerings.

[[Page 27129]]

Compared to the temporary rules, such an alternative would result in 
significantly more modest benefits for issuers, which would still have 
to incur the costs of a review report (as discussed above, such costs 
may be nontrivial compared to the typical amounts of offering 
proceeds). Obtaining a review report, even after a deferral, may be 
challenging for issuers facing significant financing constraints as a 
result of the COVID-19 shock. This alternative might lead fewer issuers 
to rely on the temporary relief and result in smaller capital formation 
benefits, compared to the temporary rules. Compared to the temporary 
rules, the review report required under this alternative would provide 
informational benefits to investors (especially since reviewed 
financial statements are not required in annual reports unless 
otherwise available) and on the margin could incentivize issuers to 
provide investors with compliant and accurate financial disclosures at 
the time investors make an investment decision. However, because 
Regulation Crowdfunding securities have transferability restrictions 
and generally are not traded in a secondary market, the benefits of a 
review report provided ex post to investors might be relatively limited 
since investors cannot readily use this information to divest or 
reallocate their investment in crowdfunding securities.\65\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \65\ See 2019 Regulation Crowdfunding Report, at 53-54.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As a different alternative, we could lower (increase) the offering 
size threshold used in conjunction with the temporary relief for 
issuers eligible under the temporary rules or for all issuers eligible 
under Regulation Crowdfunding. Table 3 below summarizes the potential 
effects of these alternatives based on historical data on offering size 
distribution.\66\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \66\ See supra note 60.
    \67\ See id.

  Table 3--Potential Number of Offerings Eligible for Temporary Relief
   From the Review Report Requirement Under Alternative Offering Size
                             Thresholds \67\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                           Offerings by
 Offerings seeking above $107,000 and up     eligible      Offerings by
                   to                         issuers       all issuers
------------------------------------------------------------------------
$200,000................................              33              44
$250,000................................              59              76
$300,000................................              96             125
$400,000................................             140             183
$500,000................................             248             324
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As noted above, the number of issuers electing to avail themselves 
of the relief under such alternatives may exceed the number of affected 
issuers on the basis of historical data if issuers previously seeking 
amounts equal to the review report threshold elect to increase offering 
size as a result of the relief. Compared to the temporary rules, the 
alternatives of lowering (increasing) the offering size threshold would 
decrease (increase) the number of issuers eligible for the review 
report exemption and the resulting capital formation and efficiency 
benefits but also lead to a smaller (larger) aggregate reduction in the 
information available to investors.

D. Temporary Suspension of Certain Timing Requirements for Offerings 
Under Regulation Crowdfunding

    The temporary rules provide eligible issuers with greater 
flexibility to close a Regulation Crowdfunding offering early and 
access capital sooner than would be possible in the absence of the 
temporary relief.
1. Temporary Suspension of 21-Day Requirement
    Existing Rule 303 of Regulation Crowdfunding specifies that the 
information in an offering statement must be publicly available for at 
least 21 days before securities may be sold, although the intermediary 
may accept investment commitments during that time, as well as imposes 
a 21-day requirement with respect to the availability of issuer 
information when a funding portal is directing a qualified third party 
to transmit funds to an issuer. As discussed in Section IV above, in 
light of the need for expedited access to capital among small business 
issuers affected by the COVID-19 shock, the temporary rules we are 
adopting would replace the 21-day requirement with the requirement that 
the intermediary make the required issuer information publicly 
available on the online platform before securities are sold in the 
offering.\68\ The intermediary will be allowed to accept investment 
commitments during the time such information is made available, but 
only if the issuer has provided complete financial information 
disclosures.\69\ In addition, the temporary rules will waive the 21-day 
requirement in Rule 303(e)(3)(i) for funding portals with respect to 
directing a transmission of funds.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \68\ Market participants have indicated that these timing 
requirements, in light of business disruptions resulting from COVID-
19, may make it difficult for issuers with urgent funding needs to 
make use of Regulation Crowdfunding to receive funds promptly. See 
supra note 2.
    \69\ See Section III.A for a discussion of an issuer's ability 
to omit financial statements pursuant to temporary Rule 201(z)(2).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The temporary rules will provide faster access to capital for 
eligible issuers that are able to reach the target amount quickly, 
resulting in potential capital formation benefits and greater 
efficiency of the capital raising process for such issuers. It is 
difficult to predict how many issuers will be affected. While 
historical data suggests that the typical offering duration was longer 
than the 21-day period,\70\ it is likely that these estimates may not 
be representative of the offering duration time frames sought by 
financially constrained issuers affected by the COVID-19 shock under 
the temporary rules that enable an expedited offering process. Some 
issuers absorbing unexpected significant shocks to their internal cash 
flows and carrying limited, if any, cash reserves,\71\ might be facing 
binding liquidity constraints or risk of insolvency after a few weeks 
without additional funding, resulting in a heightened value of 
expedited access to capital.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \70\ Based on the analysis of Form C data from inception of 
Regulation Crowdfunding through the end of 2019, we estimate that 
the average (median) duration of a Regulation Crowdfunding offering 
from initial Form C filing to offering deadline was approximately 
four months (three months).
    \71\ Based on the data from inception through the end of 2019, 
the median (average) Regulation Crowdfunding offering was made by an 
issuer with $4,655 ($78,867) in cash holdings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    We recognize that waiving the 21-day period may reduce the time 
afforded to investors to evaluate the information about the issuer 
before making the investment decision. It is important to note, 
however, that investors seeking to participate in an offering may 
continue to evaluate information about the offering after the offering 
begins accepting commitments and before the offering closes. Further, 
the requirement that all required disclosures be made available before 
the intermediary may begin accepting commitments is expected to enable 
investors to reach an informed decision. Finally, the requirement that 
prominent disclosure be provided to indicate that the offering is being 
conducted on an expedited basis is expected to inform investors about 
the modified offering process. Other important Regulation Crowdfunding 
safeguards, including extensive issuer disclosure requirements and most 
intermediary requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding, will continue to 
apply, as discussed in Section VI.A above.
    As an alternative, we considered shortening rather than eliminating 
the

[[Page 27130]]

21-day period. Compared to the temporary rules, preserving a waiting 
period before investment commitments may be accepted would provide less 
flexibility to financially constrained issuers to quickly access 
capital. At the same time, compared to the temporary rules, it would 
provide investors with additional time to evaluate information about 
the issuer. The incremental effect of such a provision for the ability 
of investors to make informed decisions about the offering is likely to 
vary across investors and issuers.
2. Temporary Changes to the Cancellation Process
    Under the existing rules investors may rescind their commitment up 
until the final 48 hours of the offering (except in the event of a 
material change to the offering, where investors may rescind the 
commitment later on). As discussed above, the temporary rules would 
narrow the rescission window to 48 hours from the time of their 
investment commitment (or such later period as the issuer may 
designate), or a material change to the offering, if it occurs at a 
later time. Further, once an issuer has received binding investment 
commitments (that is, investment commitments for which the 48-hour 
cancellation period has run) covering the target offering amount, the 
issuer will be allowed to close the offering prior to the deadline 
identified in its offering materials, but the issuer would be required 
to provide the relevant disclosure to that effect and notice that the 
target offering amount has been met. The temporary rules would waive 
the requirement that the intermediary provide notice to investors at 
least five business days prior to the new offering deadline.
    The temporary rules are expected to benefit eligible issuers by 
giving them the flexibility to close the offering and to receive access 
to the raised funds sooner, which may be particularly valuable for 
issuers facing unexpected financing constraints as a result of the 
COVID-19 shock. Reduced incidence of late investor commitment 
cancellations and the ability to more easily close an offering that has 
reached the target amount prior to the deadline can increase the 
efficiency of the offering process. As a result of expedited offering 
completion, we also expect the temporary rules to provide incremental 
benefits for capital formation and, to the extent that small issuers 
are relatively more likely to rely on these rules, we expect favorable 
effects on competition.
    By restricting investor ability to rescind commitments, the 
temporary rules will reduce investor flexibility to adjust their 
crowdfunding investments based on supplemental information (other than 
a material change to the offering) arriving more than 48 hours after 
their commitment, including the flow of other investors' commitments 
and communications on the online platform that occur more than 48 hours 
after the investor's own commitment,\72\ or based on changes in the 
investor's opinion of the issuer, financial circumstances, or other 
factors. Some investors that would have sought to cancel their 
commitment after 48 hours may find themselves unable to do so. We 
expect the prominent disclosure regarding the different cancellation 
process for issuers relying on the temporary rules to provide adequate 
notice to investors, allowing investors to adjust their initial 
commitment decisions accordingly. It is difficult to predict how a 
typical investor will adjust behavior in response to this change. Some 
investors may exercise greater caution with respect to the amount 
invested, hesitate to invest early in the offering, opting to observe 
the wisdom of the crowd, or be more inclined to cancel the commitment 
if the ``wisdom of the crowd'' (offering progress or communications 
from other investors on the online platform) within 48 hours of the 
commitment reveals mixed signals. Other investors may engage in more 
due diligence in light of the reduced ability to rely on the gradual 
accumulation of the wisdom of the crowd. These adjustments in investor 
behavior may also be affected by issuer choices with respect to 
offering duration and early closing of offerings. For example, the 
short offering duration or the possibility that an offering may close 
early may induce some investors to participate in an offering early on, 
which may counteract some of the conservatism discussed above. Thus, 
changes in investor behavior and their impacts on the likelihood of 
offering success and performance of crowdfunding investments are likely 
to vary across investors and issuers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \72\ Predictions in prior research studies regarding the impact 
of social interaction akin to ``wisdom of the crowd'' on investor 
decisions are mixed. See 2015 Regulation Crowdfunding Adopting 
Release, at 71495, footnote 1346.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Besides the required disclosure of the modified cancellation 
process and the 48-hour period for rescission of commitments for any 
reason, the ability of investors to rescind commitments in the event of 
a material change to the offering will remain as a crucial investor 
protection. Further, as discussed in Section VI.A above, various 
safeguards will continue to apply to all Regulation Crowdfunding 
offerings, including offerings relying on the temporary rules, which is 
expected to mitigate potential effects of the temporary rules on the 
risk of investor losses.
    It is difficult to predict how many issuers and investors will be 
affected by these changes. Information on amounts invested by investors 
in each offering is not available in required Regulation Crowdfunding 
disclosure. Based on a subset of data made available by one 
crowdfunding intermediary,\73\ we find that: (i) Among all investor-
initiated cancellations, the median and average cancellation time was 
approximately five and 25 days, respectively, and cancellations after 
48 hours were relatively common (58 percent of investor-initiated 
cancellations); (ii) approximately 88 percent of offerings had at least 
one investor-initiated cancellation after 48 hours, and the aggregate 
amount of such cancellations accounted for approximately 48 percent of 
all investor-initiated cancellations in dollar terms but only eight 
percent of aggregate net investor commitments in dollar terms; (iii) 
approximately nine percent of investors had initiated at least one 
cancellation, including an estimated six percent of investors that 
initiated at least one cancellation after 48 hours, however, investors 
with cancellations participated in significantly more offerings on 
average. Based on this data, while cancellations after 48 hours appear 
to be a fairly common occurrence, they were concentrated among 
relatively few investors and accounted for a small share of net 
aggregate commitments in dollar terms. We are unable to assess whether 
these data are representative of commitment cancellations for other 
issuers, platforms, and time periods, particularly in light of the 
significant market uncertainty related to the COVID-19 shock, which 
might increase investor willingness to cancel commitments as a result 
of evolving market conditions or personal financial

[[Page 27131]]

circumstances. Further, we cannot gauge what proportion of eligible 
issuers will elect to restrict commitment cancellations after 48 hours, 
permitted by the temporary rules. Finally, as discussed above, investor 
behavior with respect to initial commitments and their cancellations is 
likely to adjust at least to some extent in response to changes 
introduced by the temporary rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \73\ We examine investor-initiated cancellations outside of the 
48-hour window using a subset of data made available by Wefunder for 
a period from May 2016 through September 2018. Given the focus on 
investor cancellations, to avoid biasing the estimates, we include 
all offerings and investments, including failed and ongoing 
offerings, in the provided subset of data. Investments and investors 
have unique identifiers in the provided subset of data. We use the 
``investor canceled'' cancellation reason to differentiate investor-
initiated cancellations from cancellations due to failure to 
reconfirm a commitment following material changes, oversubscription, 
or offering expiration or termination by the issuer. These estimates 
use the full sample. Restricting the sample to offerings by eligible 
issuers in a sensitivity analysis has little effect on the discussed 
estimates.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    As an alternative, we considered extending the minimum time frame 
during which investors are able to rescind their commitments for any 
reason beyond 48 hours. Alternatively, we could shorten or even 
eliminate the 48-hour period for rescinding the commitments for any 
reason, absent a material change to the offering. The alternatives of 
shortening (extending) the time period for canceling commitments would 
provide greater (lesser) certainty to issuers with respect to interim 
progress towards the offering target and the likelihood of offering 
success, potentially making the process of raising financing under 
Regulation Crowdfunding relatively more efficient and more attractive 
to prospective issuers, compared to the temporary rules. At the same 
time, the alternatives of shortening (extending) the time period for 
canceling commitments would provide less (more) flexibility to 
investors to gradually process information about the offering and 
incorporate the gradually accumulating wisdom of the crowd in their 
final investment decision, compared to the temporary rules. It is 
likely, however, as discussed above, that at least some investors will 
adjust their behavior in response to the changes to the cancellation 
process in ways that may counteract some of these effects.

VII. Procedural and Other Matters

    The Administrative Procedure Act (``APA'') generally requires an 
agency to publish notice of a rulemaking in the Federal Register and 
provide an opportunity for public comment. This requirement does not 
apply, however, if the agency ``for good cause finds . . . that notice 
and public procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the 
public interest.'' \74\ The APA also generally requires that an agency 
publish an adopted rule in the Federal Register at least 30 days before 
it becomes effective. This requirement does not apply, however, if the 
agency finds good cause for making the rule effective sooner.\75\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \74\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).
    \75\ 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Given the temporary nature of the relief contemplated by the 
temporary final rules and the significant, unprecedented, and immediate 
impact of COVID-19 on affected issuers, as discussed above, the 
Commission finds that good cause exists to dispense with notice and 
comment as impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public 
interest, and to act immediately to amend Rules 100, 201, 301, 303 and 
304 of Regulation Crowdfunding.\76\ In particular, small businesses 
affected by the closures and safety measures designed to slow the 
spread of COVID-19 may face urgent funding needs \77\ that could be 
addressed by use of the internet to reach potential investors. In the 
current circumstances, a delay in implementation would substantially 
undermine the relief intended by the temporary rules and could 
exacerbate the existing challenges faced by many small businesses in 
urgent need of capital to continue their operations.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \76\ This finding also satisfies the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 
808(2), allowing the temporary final rules to become effective 
notwithstanding the requirement of 5 U.S.C. 801 (if a Federal agency 
finds that notice and public comment are impractical, unnecessary or 
contrary to the public interest, a rule shall take effect at such 
time as the Federal agency promulgating the rule determines). The 
temporary final rules also do not require analysis under the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act. See 5 U.S.C. 604(a) (requiring a final 
regulatory flexibility analysis only for rules required by the APA 
or other law to undergo notice and comment).
    \77\ See supra note 1.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The temporary final rules will provide relief from certain 
financial information requirements of Regulation Crowdfunding. In 
addition, the temporary final rules will require issuers relying on the 
temporary relief to provide certain additional disclosures, although we 
expect the burden of those disclosures to be minimal. Overall, we 
expect the temporary final rules to result in a net decrease in 
compliance burden per form for Form C (OMB Control No. 3235-0307); 
however, because of a possible increase in the number of issuers 
relying on Regulation Crowdfunding, we believe that the net change in 
paperwork burden will be minimal.\78\ Accordingly, we are not adjusting 
the burden or cost estimates associated with existing collections of 
information under Regulation Crowdfunding for purposes of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995.\79\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \78\ We note that the temporary nature of the amendments and the 
inherent uncertainty in estimating how many issuers will take 
advantage of the temporary relief makes estimation of the net change 
in paperwork burden difficult.
    \79\ 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Pursuant to the Congressional Review Act,\80\ the Office of 
Information and Regulatory Affairs has designated these amendments as 
``a major rule,'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
