SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Part 232

[Release Nos. 33-10749; 34-88040; 39-2530; IC-33792]


Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') is 
adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and 
Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual (``EDGAR Filer Manual'' or 
``Filer Manual'') and related rules. The EDGAR system was upgraded on 
January 27, 2020.

DATES: Effective February 19, 2020. The incorporation by reference of 
the EDGAR Filer Manual is approved by the Director of the Federal 
Register as of February 19, 2020.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For questions regarding updates to 
ATS-N submissions, please contact Tyler Raimo in the Division of 
Trading and Markets, at (202) 551-6227. For questions concerning 
eXtensible Business Reporting Language (``XBRL'') validations or 
taxonomies, please contact the Office of Structured Disclosure in the 
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, at (202) 551-5494.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: We are adopting an updated EDGAR Filer 
Manual, Volume I: ``General Information'' (Version 35) and Volume II: 
``EDGAR Filing'' (Version 53) (January 2020). The updated Filer Manual 
is incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations.
    The Filer Manual contains all the technical specifications needed 
for filers to make submissions through the EDGAR system.\1\ Filers must 
comply with the applicable provisions of the Filer Manual in order to 
assure the timely acceptance and processing of filings made in 
electronic format.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ We originally adopted the Filer Manual on April 1, 1993, 
with an effective date of April 26, 1993. Release No. 33-6986 (April 
1, 1993) [58 FR 18638]. We implemented the most recent update to the 
Filer Manual on September 27, 2019. See Release No. 33-10709 (Sept. 
27, 2019) [84 FR 56938].
    \2\ See Rule 301 of Regulation S-T (17 CFR 232.301).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The EDGAR System was updated in Release 20.1 and corresponding 
amendments to the Filer Manual are being made to reflect the changes 
described below.
    The Commission adopted amendments to regulatory requirements in 
Regulation ATS under the Exchange Act applicable to alternative trading 
systems (``ATS'') that trade National Market System (``NMS'') 
stocks.\3\ EDGAR Release 20.1 will update Form ATS-N submission types 
to provide filers with a textbox to explain when orders in the NMS 
Stock ATS can be routed from the ATS. See Chapter 8 (Preparing and 
Transmitting Online Submissions) of the EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: 
``EDGAR Filing.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Regulation of NMS Stock Alternative Trading Systems, 
Release 34-83663 (July 18, 2018) [83 FR 38768] (requiring, inter 
alia, NMS Stock ATSs to disclose information about their operations 
and post certain Form ATS-N filings on EDGAR).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    EDGAR Release 20.1 provides additional support for XBRL validation 
of Document Entity Identifier data in XBRL submissions to improve 
consistency with existing EDGAR data and data in EDGAR header elements. 
The EDGAR Filer Manual has been revised to provide additional 
instructions for tagging Document Entity Identifier data in submissions 
that contain XBRL. See Chapter 6 (Interactive Data) of the EDGAR Filer 
Manual, Volume II: ``EDGAR Filing.''
    Along with the adoption of the Filer Manual, we are amending Rule 
301 of Regulation S-T to provide for the incorporation by reference 
into the Code of Federal Regulations of the current revisions. This 
incorporation by reference was approved by the Director of the Federal 
Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51.
    The updated EDGAR Filer Manual is available for website viewing and 
printing; the address for the Filer Manual is <a href="https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/edmanuals.htm">https://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/edmanuals.htm</a>. You may also obtain paper copies of the EDGAR 
Filer Manual from the following address: Public Reference Room, U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549, on official business days between the hours of 10 a.m. and 3 
p.m.
    Because the Filer Manual and the corresponding rule and form 
amendments relate solely to agency procedures or practice, publication 
for notice and comment is not required under the Administrative 
Procedure Act (``APA'').\4\ It follows that the requirements of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act \5\ do not apply.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \4\ 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).
    \5\ 5 U.S.C. 601-612.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The effective date for the updated Filer Manual and the related 
rule and form amendments is February 19, 2020. In accord with the 
APA,\6\ we find that there is good cause to establish an effective date 
less than 30 days after publication of these rules. The Commission 
believes that establishing an effective date less than 30 days after 
publication of these rules is necessary to coordinate the effectiveness 
of the updated Filer Manual with the related system upgrades.
