SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Parts 200, 229, 249, 270, 274 and 275

[Release No. 33-11197; 34-97621; IA-6316; IC-34932]


Technical Amendments to Commission Rules and Forms

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is 
adopting technical amendments to various rules and forms under the 
Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), and the Investment Company Act of 1940 
(``Investment Company Act''), as well as to the rule setting forth 
undertakings that certain registrants must include in their 
registration statements, and to the general authority provision 
corresponding to Commission rules under the Investment Advisers Act of 
1940 (``Investment Advisers Act''). These revisions make changes to 
correct errors that are technical in nature, including typographical 
errors and erroneous cross-references in various Commission rules and 
forms.

DATES: This rule is effective June 12, 2023, except for the amendment 
to 17 CFR 200.30-5 at instruction 2, which is effective July 2, 2024.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Quinn Kane, Senior Counsel, or Amanda 
Hollander Wagner, Senior Special Counsel, at (202) 551-6792, Investment 
Company Regulation Office, Division of Investment Management, at the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 
20549.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is amending the following 
rules and forms:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
           Commission reference                 CFR citation (17 CFR)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regulation S-K:
  Item 512................................  Sec.   229.512.
Securities Act and Investment Company Act:
 \1\
  Form N-2................................  Sec.  Sec.   239.14 and
                                             274.11a-1.
  Form N-14...............................  Sec.   239.23.
Investment Company Act:
  Rule 12d1-1.............................  Sec.   270.12d1-1.
  Rule 12d1-3.............................  Sec.   270.12d1-3.
  Rule 27i-1..............................  Sec.   270.27i-1.
  Rule 30-5...............................  Sec.   200.30-5.
Exchange Act: \2\
  Form 13F................................  Sec.   249.325.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The amendments make technical changes to various Commission rules 
and forms. Some of the amendments update or correct cross-references to 
other rules or provisions. The amendments to Rule 12d1-1 and Rule 12d1-
3 under the Investment Company Act update cross-references to former 
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) rules that have been 
superseded by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) rules. 
The amendment to Form 13F corrects an erroneous cross-reference 
resulting from recent amendments to the form, which became effective on 
January 3, 2023.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq.; 15 U.S.C. 80a et seq.
    \2\ See Electronic Submission of Applications for Orders under 
the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, Confidential 
Treatment Requests for Filings on Form 13F, and Form ADV-NR; 
Amendments to Form 13F, Investment Company Act Release No. 34635 
(June 23, 2022) [87 FR 38943 (June 30, 2022)]. Special Instruction 
11 to Form 13F erroneously states that the Information Table should 
be presented ``in accordance with the column instructions provided 
in Special Instructions 11.b.i through 12.b.viii.'' (emphasis 
added). This error is the result of Special Instruction 2 being 
deleted, causing a renumbering of the ensuing instructions. The 
Commission is therefore adopting an amendment to update the Special 
Instruction to provide an accurate cross-reference consistent with 
the Commission's statement that this Instruction would cross 
reference ``. . . the column instructions provided in Special 
Instructions 11.b.i through 11b.viii.'' (emphasis added).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Other amendments are intended to make technical updates to 
instructions associated with certain form requirements, and to make 
typographical and other corrections to inadvertent errors or omissions, 
including removing outdated references in rules and forms. The 
amendments related to Instruction 3.D to the Calculation of Filing Fee 
Tables and Related Disclosure in Item 25 of Form N-2 and Item 16 of N-
14 make typographical corrections designed to make the instructions 
consistent with a simplified construction that was incorporated in 
parallel instructions to other forms as part of a recent Commission 
rulemaking.\3\ Other amendments to Form N-2 and Item 512 of Regulation 
S-K modify references that have in recent years been rendered 
obsolete.\4\ The amendment to Rule 27i-1 under the Investment Company 
Act restores language in the rule text that was inadvertently removed 
when this rule was renumbered in a recent rulemaking, in light of the 
renumbering of section 27(c) of the Investment Company Act to section 
27(i) enacted by the National Securities Market Improvement Act of 
1996.\5\ The corrections to Rule 30-5 under the Investment Company Act 
are designed to conform the rule to the standard paragraph numbering 
structure for Commission rules.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \3\ See Filing Fee Disclosure and Payment Methods Modernization, 
Investment Company Act Release No. 34396 (Oct. 13, 2021) [86 FR 
70166 (Dec. 9, 2021)] (``2021 Fee Tagging Release''). In this 
rulemaking the Commission amended a number of fee-bearing forms, 
schedules, statements, and related rules to require each filing fee 
table and accompanying disclosure to include all required 
information for fee calculation in a structured format. 
Specifically, we are correcting language in an example to the above-
referenced instruction that currently refers to a pre-effective 
amendment to the filing of the Form N-2 on 2/15/20X1 by changing 
this language to instead refer to a pre-effective amendment to the 
Form N-2 filed on 2/15/20X1.
    \4\ Item 34.3.a.(2) of Form N-2 currently contains an exception 
to a requirement for filers to furnish certain undertakings to 
reflect fundamental changes to information provided in registration 
statements for changes in the price and volume of an offering that 
deviates by no more than 20% from the maximum aggregate offering 
price set forth in the Calculation of Registration Fee table. This 
table was removed pursuant to the 2021 Fee Tagging Release and was 
replaced with the Calculation of Filing Fee tables, filed as an 
exhibit to the fund's effective registration exhibit. Item 
34.3.a.(2) should have therefore been amended at that time to 
instead refer to the Calculation of Filing Fee tables, which set 
forth the maximum aggregate offering price upon which this exception 
is contingent. Accordingly, we are amending Item 34.3.a(2) in this 
release in order to correct this erroneous reference. We are making 
corresponding amendments to Item 512(a)(1)(ii) of Regulation S-K, 
which the undertaking in Item 34.3.a mirrors, for the same reasons.
    \5\ See Updated Disclosure Requirements and Summary Prospectus 
for Variable Annuity and Variable Life Insurance Contracts, 
Investment Company Act Release No. 33814 (Mar. 11, 2020) [85 FR 
25964 (May 1, 2020)] at 26110.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Lastly, the Commission is removing an erroneously included general 
authority provision for 17 CFR part 275, which contains Commission 
rules under the Investment Advisers Act.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \6\ This authority provision was added in conjunction with a 
rule 211h-1 under the Advisers Act, which the Commission had 
proposed but did not adopt. See Form CRS Relationship Summary; 
Amendments to Form ADV, Exchange Act Release No. 86032 (June 5, 
2019) [84 FR 33492 July 12, 2019] at n. 1198.
