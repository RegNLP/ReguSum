SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

Background

    The final regulations (TD 9890) that are the subject of this 
correction are issued under section 1441of the Internal Revenue Code.

Need for Correction

    As published, January 2, 2020 (85 FR 192), the final regulations 
(TD 9890) contain an error that needs to be corrected.

List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1

    Income taxes, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.

Correction of Publication

    Accordingly, 26 CFR part 1 is corrected by making the following 
correcting amendments:

PART 1--INCOME TAXES

0
Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in 
part as follows:

    Authority: 26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *


0
Par. 2. Section 1.1441-6 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(D) 
to read as follows:


Sec.  1.1441-6  Claim of reduced withholding under an income tax 
treaty.

* * * * *
    (b) * * *
    (2) * * *
    (iv) * * *
    (D) Example 4--(1) Facts. Entity E is a business organization 
formed under the laws of Country Y. Country Y has an income tax treaty 
with the United States that contains a limitation on benefits 
provision. E receives U.S. source royalties from withholding agent W. E 
furnishes a beneficial owner withholding certificate to W claiming a 
reduced rate of withholding under the U.S.-Country Y tax treaty. 
However, E's beneficial owner withholding certificate does not 
specifically identify the limitation on benefits provision that E 
satisfies.
    (2) Analysis. Because E's withholding certificate does not 
specifically identify the limitation on benefits provision under the 
U.S.-Country Y tax treaty that E satisfies as required by paragraph 
(b)(1)(i) of this section, W cannot rely on E's withholding certificate 
to apply the reduced rate of withholding claimed by E.
