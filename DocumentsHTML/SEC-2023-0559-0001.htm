SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

17 CFR Part 249

[Release No. 34-97478]


Technical Amendments to Form BD and Form BDW

AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.

ACTION: Final rule; technical amendments.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is 
making technical amendments to Form BD and Form BDW, the uniform 
broker-dealer registration form and the uniform request for withdrawal 
from broker-dealer registration, respectively. The technical amendments 
will update the current list of self-regulatory organizations 
(``SROs'') and government jurisdictions listed on Form BD and Form BDW, 
and make conforming changes to the definition of ``jurisdiction'' in 
the forms.

DATES: Effective Date: May 23, 2023.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Emily Westerberg Russell, Chief 
Counsel, Joanne Rutkowski, Assistant Chief Counsel, Denise Landers, 
Senior Special Counsel, or Bonnie Gauch, Senior Special Counsel, at 
(202) 551-5550, Office of the Chief Counsel, Division of Trading and 
Markets, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, 
Washington, DC 20549.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Form BD requires an applicant, or 
registrant, to indicate the SRO and governmental jurisdiction with 
which it is registering or registered. For a ``partial withdrawal,'' 
\1\ Form BDW requires the applicant to specify the SRO and governmental 
jurisdiction from which it is withdrawing.\2\ The Commission is making 
technical amendments to Item 2 of Form BD and Item 3 of Form BDW to 
update the list of governmental jurisdictions to include Guam, and to 
update the list of SROs to reflect the registrations of new national 
securities exchanges or the business combinations and resulting name 
changes of existing SROs since the last update of Form BD and Form BDW. 
More specifically, we are updating the list of SROs to reflect these 
changes to: BOX Exchange LLC (BOX),\3\ Cboe Exchange, Inc. (CBOE),\4\ 
Cboe BYX Exchange, Inc. (Cboe BYX),\5\ Cboe BZX Exchange, Inc. (Cboe 
BZX),\6\ Cboe C2 Exchange, Inc. (C2),\7\ Cboe EDGA Exchange, Inc. (Cboe 
EDGA),\8\ Cboe EDGX Exchange, Inc. (Cboe EDGX),\9\ Investors Exchange 
LLC (IEX),\10\ Long-Term Stock Exchange, Inc. (LTSE),\11\ Nasdaq BX, 
Inc. (BX),\12\ Nasdaq GEMX, LLC (GEMX),\13\ Nasdaq

[[Page 32964]]

ISE, LLC (ISE),\14\ Nasdaq MRX, LLC (MRX),\15\ Nasdaq PHLX LLC 
(PHLX),\16\ The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (NASDAQ),\17\ NYSE American LLC 
(NYSE AMER),\18\ NYSE Chicago, Inc. (NYSE CHX),\19\ NYSE National, Inc. 
(NYSE NAT),\20\ Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC 
(MIAX),\21\ MIAX EMERALD, LLC (EMERALD),\22\ MIAX PEARL, LLC 
(PEARL),\23\ and MEMX LLC (MEMX).\24\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \1\ A ``full withdrawal'' terminates registration with the 
Commission, all SROs, and all jurisdictions. However, a ``partial 
withdrawal'' terminates registration with specific jurisdictions and 
SROs, but does not terminate registration with the Commission and at 
least one SRO and jurisdiction.
    \2\ Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
(``Exchange Act'') provides that broker-dealers can register and 
withdraw from registration under procedures developed by the 
Commission. Exchange Act Rule 15b1-1 requires that an application 
for registration of a broker or dealer that is filed pursuant to 
Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act be filed on Form BD in accordance 
with the instructions on the form. Exchange Act Rule 15b6-1 requires 
that a notice of withdrawal from registration as a broker or dealer 
filed pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act be filed on Form 
BDW in accordance with the instructions on the form. See 15 U.S.C. 
78o; 17 CFR 240.15b1-1 and 15b6-1. See also, Form BD and Form BDW 17 
CFR 249.501 and 501a.
