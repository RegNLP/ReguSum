    (B) Calculation rules when certificates are submitted under Sec.  
1.1446-6--(1) To the extent applicable, in computing the 1446 tax due 
with respect to a foreign partner, a partnership may consider a 
certificate received from such partner under Sec.  1.1446-6(c)(1)(i) or 
(ii) and the amount of state and local taxes permitted to be considered 
under Sec.  1.1446-6(c)(1)(iii). For the purposes of applying this 
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B), a partnership shall first annualize the 
partner's allocable share of the partnership's items of effectively 
connected income, gain, deduction, and loss before--
    (i) Considering under Sec.  1.1446-6(c)(1)(i) the partner's 
certified deductions and losses;
    (ii) Determining under Sec.  1.1446-6(c)(1)(ii) whether the 1446 
tax otherwise due with respect to that partner is less than $1,000 
(determined with regard to any certified deductions or losses); or
    (iii) Considering under Sec.  1.1446-6(c)(1)(iii) the amount of 
state and local taxes withheld and remitted on behalf of the partner.
    (2) The amount of the limitation provided in Sec.  1.1446-
6(c)(1)(i)(C) shall be based on the partner's allocable share of these 
annualized amounts. For any installment period in which the partnership 
considers a partner's certificate, the partnership must also consider 
the following events to the extent they occur prior to the due date for 
paying the 1446 tax for such installment period--
    (i) The receipt of an updated certificate or status update from the 
partner under Sec.  1.1446-6(c)(2)(ii)(B) certifying an amount of 
deductions or losses that is less than the amount reflected on the 
superseded certificate (see Sec.  1.1446-6(e)(2) Example 4);
    (ii) The failure to receive an updated certificate or status update 
from the partner that should have been provided under Sec.  1.1446-
6(c)(2)(ii)(B); and
    (iii) The receipt of a notification from the IRS under Sec.  
1.1446-6(c)(3) or (5) (see Sec.  1.1446-6(e)(2) Example 5).
