PART 1--INCOME TAXES

0
Paragraph 1. The authority citation for part 1 continues to read in 
part as follows:

    Authority:  26 U.S.C. 7805 * * *


0
Par. 2. Section 1.245A-5 is amended by:
0
a. Adding a sentence after the first sentence of paragraph 
(e)(3)(i)(A); and
0
b. Revising paragraphs (i)(8) and (9) and the first sentence of 
paragraph (j)(10)(ii).
    The addition and revisions read as follows:


Sec.  1.245A-5   Limitation of section 245A deduction and section 
954(c)(6) exception.

* * * * *
    (e) * * *
    (3) * * *
    (i) * * *
    (A) * * * Because the determination as to whether there would be an 
extraordinary reduction amount or tiered extraordinary reduction amount 
greater than zero is made without regard to this paragraph (e)(3)(i), 
this determination is made without taking into account any elections 
that may be available, or other events that may occur, solely by reason 
of an election described in this paragraph (e)(3)(i), such as the 
application of section 954(b)(4) to a short taxable year created as a 
result of the election. * * *
* * * * *
    (i) * * *
    (8) Extraordinary disposition E&P. The term extraordinary 
disposition E&P has the meaning set forth in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(C) of 
this section.
    (9) Extraordinary disposition ownership percentage. The term 
extraordinary disposition ownership percentage has the meaning set 
forth in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B) of this section.
* * * * *
    (j) * * *
    (10) * * *
    (ii) * * * Because the loan from CFC1 to CFC2 and the subsequent 
distribution of cash were carried out with a principal purpose of 
avoiding the purposes of this section, appropriate adjustments are 
required to be made under the anti-abuse rule in paragraph (h) of this 
section. * * *
