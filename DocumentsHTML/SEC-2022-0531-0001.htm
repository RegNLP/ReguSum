    Rule 206(4)-1..............................             275.206(4)-1
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The amendments make a number of technical changes to Commission 
rules and forms. Several of the amendments update or correct cross-
references to rules or provisions. For example, the Commission is 
amending rule 22c-1 to clarify an internal cross-reference in the rule. 
Likewise, the Commission is amending rule 18f-4, which it adopted in 
late 2020, to clarify an internal cross-reference in the rule.\3\ 
Similarly, the amendment to rule 22e-3 clarifies cross-references to 
certain definitions in 17 CFR 270.2a-7 (Investment Company Act rule 2a-
7). In addition, we are amending rule 405 to correct an error in 
provision (b)(3)(iii), which was adopted by the Commission in 2020.\4\ 
This amendment would add a cross-reference to the statutory provisions 
cited in corresponding Form N-2 instructions that specify structured 
data tagging requirements. Finally, we are also amending Form N-5 to 
clarify cross-references to Regulation S-X and to update the reference 
to Commission fees under section 6(b) of the Securities Act and 17 CFR 
230.457 (rule 457 thereunder).

and Business Development Companies, Release No. IC-34084 (Nov. 2, 
2020) [85 FR 83162 (Dec. 21, 2020)] (``2020 Derivatives Release''). 
The definition of ``designated reference portfolio'' in rule 18f-4 
includes an erroneous reference to ``paragraph (2) of the definition 
of designated index of this section.'' Because the rule's definition 
of ``designated index'' includes no paragraph (2), we are adopting 
an amendment that will update the definition of ``designated 
reference portfolio'' to instead reference the first sentence of 
``designated index.'' The 2020 Derivatives Release reflects the 
Commission's intent to cross-reference in the definition of 
``designated reference portfolio'' this part of the definition of 
``designated index.'' See 2020 Derivatives Release at paragraph 
accompanying nn.339-340.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In addition, the Commission is updating forms to clarify 
instructions and to make typographical and other corrections, including 
removing outdated information.\5\ For example, when the Commission 
previously amended Form N-CEN to add additional reporting items, the 
form did not accurately reflect the reporting entities that must 
respond to the additional items adopted by the Commission.\6\ 
Similarly, when the Commission previously amended Form N-3, it 
inadvertently omitted the paragraph on the cover page of this form 
specifying that a registrant is required to disclose the information 
that the form specifies, that the Commission will make this information 
public, and that a registrant is not required to respond to the 
collection of information that the form contains unless the form 
displays a currently valid Office of Management and Budget control 
number.\7\ This release also makes a technical correction to clarify 
that the scope of the amendments to the General Instructions to Item 
25.2 of Form N-2 described in the Filing Fee Disclosure and Payment 
Methods Modernization Adopting Release did not remove existing 
Instructions 6 and 7.\8\ Additionally, the Commission is amending the 
general instructions to Form ADV with respect to when an adviser is 
required to file an updating amendment to accurately reflect that 
advisers are required to file an other than annual updating amendment 
in the event any information reported with respect to relying advisers 
in Section 4 of Schedule R of Form ADV becomes materially inaccurate. 
The current instructions incorrectly reference Section 10 of Schedule 
R, which does not exist.\9\

Annuity Summary Prospectus Adopting Release''). The Commission 
proposed to include this paragraph in Form N-3, however, it was 
inadvertently omitted in the final rule. See Updated Disclosure 
Requirements and Summary Prospectus for Variable Annuity and 
Variable Life Insurance Contracts, Release, No. 33-10569 (Feb. 15, 
2019) [83 FR 61730 (Nov. 30, 2018)]. The Commission also included a
