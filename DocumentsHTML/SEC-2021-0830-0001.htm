1. The authority citation for part 240 continues to read, in part, as 
follows:

    Authority:  15 U.S.C. 77c, 77d, 77g, 77j, 77s, 77z-2, 77z-3,

78o-10, 78p, 78q, 78q-1, 78s, 78u-5, 78w, 78x, 78dd, 78ll, 78mm, 
80a-20, 80a-23, 80a-29, 80a-37, 80b-3, 80b-4, 80b-11, and 7201 et 
seq., and 8302; 7 U.S.C. 2(c)(2)(E); 12 U.S.C. 5221(e)(3); 18 U.S.C. 
1350; Pub. L. 111-203, 939A, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010); and Pub. L. 112-
106, sec. 503 and 602, 126 Stat. 326 (2012), unless otherwise noted.
* * * * *
    Section 240.17a-14 is also issued under Public Law 111-203, sec. 
913, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010).
* * * * *

2. Amend Sec.  240.17a-4 by revising paragraphs (a) and (l) to read as 
follows:


Sec.  240.17a-4   Records to be preserved by certain exchange members, 
brokers and dealers.

* * * * *
    (a) Every member, broker or dealer subject to Sec.  240.17a-3 must 
preserve for a period of not less than 6 years, the first two years in 
an easily accessible place, all records required to be made pursuant to 
Sec.  240.17a-3(a)(1) through (3), (5), and (21) and (22), and 
analogous records created pursuant to Sec.  240.17a-3(e).
* * * * *
    (l) Records for the most recent two year period required to be made 
pursuant to Sec.  240.17a-3(f) and paragraphs (b)(4) and (e)(7) of this 
section which relate to an office shall be maintained at the office to 
which they relate. If an office is a private residence where only one 
associated person (or multiple associated persons who reside at that 
location and are members of the same immediate family) regularly 
conducts business, and it is not held out to the public as an office 
nor are funds or securities of any customer of the member, broker or 
dealer handled there, the member, broker or dealer need not maintain 
records at that office, but the records must be maintained at another 
location within the same State as the member, broker or dealer may 
select. Rather than maintain the records at each office, the member, 
broker or dealer may choose to produce the records promptly at the 
request of a representative of a securities regulatory authority at the 
office to which they relate or at another location agreed to by the 
representative.
* * * * *

3. Amend Sec.  240.17a-12 by revising paragraph (i)(2) to read as 
follows:


Sec.  240.17a-12   Reports to be made by certain OTC derivatives 
dealers.

* * * * *
    (i) * * *
    (2) If, during the course of the audit or interim work, the 
certified public accountant determines that any material inadequacies 
exist in the accounting system, internal accounting controls, 
procedures for safeguarding securities, or as otherwise defined in 
paragraph (h)(2) of this section, then the certified public accountant 
shall call it to the attention of the chief financial officer of the 
OTC derivatives dealer, who shall inform the Commission by telegraphic 
or facsimile notice within 24 hours thereafter as set forth in Sec.  
240.17a-11. The OTC derivatives dealer shall also furnish the certified 
public accountant with a copy of said notice to the Commission by 
telegram or facsimile within the same 24 hour period. If the certified 
public accountant fails to receive such notice from the OTC derivatives 
dealer within that 24 hour period, or if the certified public 
accountant disagrees with the statements contained in the notice of the 
OTC derivatives dealer, the certified public accountant shall inform 
the Commission by report of material inadequacy within 24 hours 
thereafter as set forth in Sec.  240.17a-11. Such report from the 
certified public accountant shall, if the OTC derivatives dealer failed 
to file a notice, describe any material inadequacies found to exist. If 
the OTC derivatives dealer filed a notice, the certified public 
accountant shall file a report detailing the aspects, if any, of the 
OTC derivatives dealer's notice with which the certified public 
accountant does not agree.
